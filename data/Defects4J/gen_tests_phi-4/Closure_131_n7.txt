public void testUnicodePropertyName() {
    // Simulate the behavior described in the bug report
    String input = "var test={\"a\\u0004b\":\"c\"};";
    String expected = "var test={\"a\\u0004b\":\"c\"};";
    
    // Assuming there's a method to compile and return the output
    String output = compileString(input);
    
    assertEquals(expected, output);
}

Note: You would need to implement or simulate the `compileString` method to reflect the described behavior of converting `\u0004` to its character representation.
