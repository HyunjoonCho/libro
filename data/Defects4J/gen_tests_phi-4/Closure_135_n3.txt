public void testInheritanceNotDetected() {
    // Setup the classes as described in the bug report
    class SuperClass {
        public void CustomMethod() {
            // Original method implementation
        }

    class SubClass extends SuperClass {
        @Override
        public void CustomMethod() {
            this.myProperty = "value";
        }
    }

    // Instantiate SubClass
    SubClass subClassInstance = new SubClass();

    // Directly assign prototype (simulating the issue)
    SubClass.prototype = new SuperClass();

    // Attempt to call the overridden method
    subClassInstance.CustomMethod();

    // Check if the overridden method works as expected
    // In this case, we would expect no exception to be thrown
    // and potentially check the state of myProperty if it were accessible
    // Assert that myProperty is set correctly (if accessible)
    // assertEquals("value", subClassInstance.myProperty);
}

Note: This is a conceptual translation into Java, as JavaScript's prototype inheritance doesn't directly map to Java's class inheritance. The test checks if the overridden method is called without issues, simulating the JavaScript behavior. Adjustments might be needed based on actual Java implementation details.
