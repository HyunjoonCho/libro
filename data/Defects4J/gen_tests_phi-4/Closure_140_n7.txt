public void testGoogleCommonLoaderExtern() {
    try {
        Resources resources = Resources.getResource("nonexistent/resource/path");
        byte[] data = resources.asByteSource().read();
        fail("Expected an IOException due to nonexistent resource.");
    } catch (IOException expected) {
        // Expected exception due to resource not found
    }
}

This test assumes the failure occurs when trying to load a non-existent resource, which should throw an `IOException`. Adjust the resource path and expected behavior based on the specific details of the bug report.
