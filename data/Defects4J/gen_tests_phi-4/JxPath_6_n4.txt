public void testMultiValuedVariableEquality() {
    String[] values = {"a", "b"};
    Variable d = new Variable(values);

    assertTrue(d.equals("a")); // should return true
    assertTrue(d.equals("b")); // should return true
}

Note: This test assumes that the `Variable` class has a method `equals` that should correctly iterate over its components to check for equality. The test checks that both `"a"` and `"b"` are considered equal to the variable `d`.
