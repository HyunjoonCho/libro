public void testPrivatePropRedeclaration() {
    Foo foo = new Foo();
    SubFoo subFoo = new SubFoo();

    // The test verifies that no visibility warning is thrown
    // when a private property is redeclared in a subclass.
    // In the expected environment, you should manually check
    // the output for absence of a visibility error.
}

Note: Since the original bug report pertains to JavaScript and its annotations, this Java method is intended as a conceptual translation. In practice, Java does not use the same annotation system, so this test would be more about asserting the absence of a specific warning in a JavaScript environment rather than being runnable in Java.
