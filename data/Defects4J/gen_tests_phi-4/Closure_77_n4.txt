public void testNullCharacterString() {
    String testString = "\0";
    assertEquals("\\0", testString);
}

This test checks that the string `"\\0"` is interpreted correctly as a single backslash followed by a zero, rather than as three null characters. Adjust the expected value based on the actual behavior you want to verify.
