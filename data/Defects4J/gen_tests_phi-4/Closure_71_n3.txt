public void testIssueNoWarningsWhenPrivatePropIsRedeclaredOnSubclass() {
    Foo foo = new Foo();
    SubFoo subFoo = new SubFoo();

    // Assuming a hypothetical method to check for warnings/errors
    boolean hasWarning = checkForWarnings(subFoo);
    
    // Assert that there should be a warning, but there isn't

}

Note: This test assumes the existence of a method `checkForWarnings` that simulates the compilation and checks for warnings/errors. You would need to implement or mock this functionality to fully test the described behavior.
