public void testProcessRequireCallBug() {
    // Assuming `processRequireCall` is a method that modifies an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
    // and `requiresLevel` is a context object that controls behavior

    // Mock the AST and requiresLevel
    ASTNode ast = createMockASTWithInvalidRequireCall("invalidSymbol");
    RequiresLevel requiresLevel = createMockRequiresLevel(true);

    // Call the method that is supposed to process require calls
    ProcessClosurePrimitives.processRequireCall(ast, requiresLevel);

    // Assert that the invalid require call is still present in the AST
    assertTrue(ast.containsRequireCall("invalidSymbol"));
}

Note: This is a conceptual test. You'll need to adapt it to fit the actual structure and methods of your codebase, such as how you create and manipulate the AST and mock `requiresLevel`.
