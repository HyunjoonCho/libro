        // Simulating the JavaScript behavior in Java
        class I {
            // Simulating the data member on an interface
            String foobar;
        }

        class C implements I {
            public C() {
                this.foobar = "2"; // Assigning to the data member
            }
        }

        I test = new C();
        assertEquals("2", test.foobar);
    }
}

This Java test simulates the behavior described in the bug report by using a class (`I`) to represent the interface and another class (`C`) implementing it. The test checks if the `foobar` data member can be assigned and accessed as expected.
