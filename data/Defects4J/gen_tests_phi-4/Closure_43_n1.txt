public void testLendsAnnotationError() {
    // Simulate the setup that leads to the error
    class Person {
        public void sayHello() {
            System.out.println("Hello");
        }
    }

    // Attempt to use @lends-like annotation before class definition
    // Note: This is a conceptual representation as JUnit cannot directly test JS annotations.
    // The test is designed to reflect the conditions described in the bug report.

    // Simulate a compile error scenario
    assertThrows(CompilationErrorException.class, () -> {
        // Simulated code that would cause the error
        // This is a placeholder to represent the error condition
        // as actual JS code execution and annotation parsing is not possible in JUnit
    });
}

**Note:** This test is conceptual because JUnit does not directly handle JavaScript or its annotations. The test reflects the conditions described in the bug report, assuming a mechanism to simulate or trigger the described compile error.
