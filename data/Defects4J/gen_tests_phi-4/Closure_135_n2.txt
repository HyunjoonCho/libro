public void testInheritanceNotDetected() {
    // Setting up the environment to mimic JavaScript inheritance issue
    SubClass subClassInstance = new SubClass();
    
    // Expecting CustomMethod to be inherited and overridden correctly
    subClassInstance.CustomMethod();
    
    assertEquals("value", subClassInstance.myProperty);
}

In this test method, we simulate the JavaScript inheritance scenario using Java-like pseudocode. The method checks if `CustomMethod` is correctly overridden in `SubClass`, and verifies that `myProperty` is set to `"value"`, as expected. The test is designed to reproduce the failure when inheritance is not detected due to direct prototype assignment.
