public void testReturnsDeepStubsSerializationIssue() {
    ToBeMocked mock = mock(ToBeMocked.class, RETURNS_DEEP_STUBS);
    assertThat(mock.getSomething()).isNotNull();
}

In this test, you would need to ensure that the Mockito configuration is set up to use `RETURNS_DEEP_STUBS` and observe the exception as described in the bug report. This test will fail due to the serialization issue in Mockito 1.10.5 when `RETURNS_DEEP_STUBS` is used with a non-serializable class.
