public void testInvalidPropertyErrorInPrototypeFunction() {
    // Assuming ns.MyClass and ns.Thing are defined somewhere in the Java codebase
    ns.Thing thing = new ns.Thing(new ns.Subthing(null)); // subthing.noprop is null
    ns.MyClass c = new ns.MyClass(thing);
    c.doIt();
}

**Note:** This test assumes that the Java codebase has equivalent classes and methods to represent the JavaScript code provided. The test checks if the method `doIt()` does not throw an error when accessing `subthing.noprop`, which is expected to be `null`.
