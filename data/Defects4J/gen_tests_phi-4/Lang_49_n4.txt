public void testInfiniteLoopInReduce() {
    Fraction fraction = new Fraction(0, 5);
    fraction.reduce();
    // Assuming the reduce method will throw an exception or otherwise fail
    // to demonstrate that it doesn't enter an infinite loop.

Note: This assumes that the `Fraction` class has a `reduce` method and that it modifies the instance in place. Adjust the assertion based on the expected behavior of the `reduce` method.
