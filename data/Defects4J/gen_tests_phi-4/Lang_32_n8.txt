public void testThreadLocalMemoryLeak() {
    // Simulating the creation of a thread local in ToStringStyle
    ThreadLocal<String> threadLocal = new ThreadLocal<String>() {
        @Override
        protected String initialValue() {
            return "InitialValue";
        }

    // Access the thread local value to simulate usage
    String value = threadLocal.get();
    
    // Attempt to remove the thread local to prevent memory leak
    threadLocal.remove();

    // Check if the thread local has been removed
    assertNull(threadLocal.get());
}

Note: This test simulates the creation and removal of a `ThreadLocal` to ensure it is properly cleaned up, which is the root cause of the memory leak described. The test ensures that after calling `threadLocal.remove()`, the value is no longer accessible, preventing a memory leak.
