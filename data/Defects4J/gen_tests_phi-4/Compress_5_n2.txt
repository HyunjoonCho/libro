public void testTruncatedZipArchiveInputStream() throws IOException {
    InputStream truncatedZipStream = createTruncatedZipInputStream();
    ZipArchiveInputStream zipInputStream = new ZipArchiveInputStream(truncatedZipStream);

    }
}

In this test, `createTruncatedZipInputStream()` should be a method that provides a truncated ZIP file input stream. The test expects an `IOException` to be thrown when attempting to read from the truncated ZIP file, demonstrating the failure behavior described in the bug report.
