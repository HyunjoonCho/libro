public void testGoogleCommonLoaderExtern() {
    try {
        Class<?> clazz = Class.forName("com.example.ExternClass");

        fail("ExternClass should be found by the loader");
    }
}

In this test, replace `"com.example.ExternClass"` with the actual class name that should be loaded. The test will pass if the class is found, and fail if it throws a `ClassNotFoundException`, indicating the loader issue. Adjust the class name and logic based on the specific details of the failure.
