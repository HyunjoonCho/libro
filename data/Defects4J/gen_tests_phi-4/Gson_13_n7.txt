public void testNegativeZeroRoundingTrip() {
    String jsonInput = "0";  // JSON input containing `-0` represented as `0`

}

This test method attempts to reproduce the issue by using Gson to roundtrip a JSON input that should contain a negative zero (`-0`). As described in the bug report, the issue is that Gson treats `-0` as `0` due to its internal handling of numbers. The test checks if the output JSON string is `-0` after the roundtrip, which it currently is not due to the handling discrepancy. The proposed change aims to address this by treating `-0` appropriately within the Gson parser.
