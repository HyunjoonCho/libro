public void testSuperReplacementIssue() {
    // Assuming there is a method that simulates the compilation process

Note: This test assumes the existence of a method `compileJavaScriptWithOptimizations` that simulates the compilation process and returns the resulting JavaScript code as a string. Adjust the implementation details according to your project's specifics.
