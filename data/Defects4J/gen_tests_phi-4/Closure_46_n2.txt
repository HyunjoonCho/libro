public void testClassCastException() {
    try {
        ProxyObjectType proxyType = new ProxyObjectType("Proxy", new RecordType("Record"));
        proxyType.typeCheck(); // Assuming this method triggers the type check pass

This test assumes that `ProxyObjectType` and `RecordType` are classes in your codebase, and `typeCheck()` is the method that triggers the type check pass where the exception occurs. Adjust the class and method names as necessary to fit your actual implementation.
