public void testPossibleNpeWithPowerMockito() {
    try {
        // Attempt to mock a non-mockable class
        MyClass mock = PowerMockito.mock(MyClass.class);
        // Invoke some method on the mock to trigger the NPE
        mock.someMethod();
    } catch (NullPointerException npe) {
        assertTrue("Caught expected NullPointerException", true);
    }
}

In this test, replace `MyClass` with the actual class that cannot be mocked, and `someMethod()` with a method invocation that would trigger the NPE. The test catches the `NullPointerException` and asserts that it was expected.
