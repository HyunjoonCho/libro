public void testInverseCumulativeProbabilityFailure() {
    DistributionFactory factory = new DistributionFactoryImpl(); // Assuming this is how you obtain a factory instance
    NormalDistribution normal = factory.createNormalDistribution(0, 1);
    assertThrows(MathException.class, () -> normal.inverseCumulativeProbability(0.9772498680518209));
}

Note: This test assumes the existence of a `DistributionFactoryImpl` class that provides a method `createNormalDistribution(double mean, double deviation)`. Adjust the factory instantiation as necessary based on your actual codebase. The `assertThrows` method is used to verify that the expected exception is thrown.
