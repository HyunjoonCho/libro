    // Before fix: Shape is explicitly set to "TEXT", should respect locale
    assertEquals("1,000.00", formatValue(1000.00, "TEXT", specificLocale));
    
    // After fix: Shape is explicitly set to "NUMBER", should not respect locale

This test method checks that when the shape is explicitly set to "NUMBER", the locale should not affect the formatting, ensuring that the explicit shape value takes precedence. Before the fix, the test would fail if locale affected the format when shape was "TEXT", and after the fix, it should pass regardless of the locale when shape is "NUMBER".
