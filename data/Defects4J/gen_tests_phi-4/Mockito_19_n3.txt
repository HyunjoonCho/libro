public void testInjectMocksIssue() {

    // This should inject the mock into txtNextStep, but it mistakenly injects into txtGateView
    Mockito.injectMocks(activity);
    
    // Validate if the wrong field (txtGateView) was injected
    assertEquals(txtGateView, activity.txtGateView);

}

**Note:** This test assumes that the class `MyActivity` contains the fields `txtGateView` and `txtNextStep` as `TextView` objects. The `injectMocks` issue is simulated by injecting a mock into the wrong field. In a real test, you would verify the actual behavior and outcomes as applicable to your application logic.
