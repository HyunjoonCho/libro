public void testInvalidLeftHandSideAssignment() {
    assertThrows(SyntaxErrorException.class, () -> {
        // This is pseudo-code to represent the scenario, as Java does not directly support this syntax.
        // In an actual Java context, this would be caught at compile-time.
        int x = 0, y = 1;
        x || y = 8;
    });
}

Note: Since Java does not have the same syntax as the language in the bug report, the test is conceptual and assumes a custom parser that throws a `SyntaxErrorException` for such cases.
