public void testThisTypeChecking() {
    G g = new G();
    g.bar();

    // Expecting a warning or error if "this" type checking is not handled properly
    // since G.prototype.bar should not be able to call baz() directly.
}

class F {
    void bar() {
        this.baz();
    }

    void baz() {
    }
}

class G extends F {
    @Override
    void bar() {
        super.bar(); // This should work
    }
}

In this setup, calling `g.bar()` on an instance of `G` should work because `bar` is inherited from `F`, but if there were a direct call to `baz()` from `G`'s `bar`, it would result in a type error since `G` does not have a `baz` method. This test checks if the inheritance and method overriding are handled correctly.
