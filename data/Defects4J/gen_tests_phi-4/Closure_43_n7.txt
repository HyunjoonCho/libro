Note: Since JUnit is primarily used for testing Java code and the described issue involves JavaScript and the jsdoc-toolkit, the above code is a conceptual translation meant to illustrate how you might set up a test to simulate the described behavior in a Java-like context. The actual issue pertains to JavaScript and would not be directly testable with JUnit.
