public void testWrongConstructorPickedUpDuringDeserialization() throws IOException {
    ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
    SimplePojo pojo = mapper.readValue("{ \"intField\": 1, \"stringField\": \"foo\" }", SimplePojo.class);

This test method is designed to reproduce the issue where Jackson does not use the `@JsonCreator` annotated constructor when deserializing an object with multiple constructors. The exception thrown during the test confirms that the incorrect constructor is being selected.
