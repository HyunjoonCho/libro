public void testVarTypeDeclaration() {
    MyClass x = null;
    try {
        x.show();
        fail("Expected NullPointerException");
    } catch (NullPointerException e) {
        // Expected behavior
    }
}

class MyClass {
    int value = 1;
    
    void show() {
        System.out.println(value);
    }
}

This test method attempts to call `show()` on a `null` object, which should result in a `NullPointerException`, thus reproducing the behavior described in the bug report. Note that Java does not have a `var` keyword with type annotations like in JavaScript, so the test simulates the scenario by directly using `null` assignment and type declaration.
