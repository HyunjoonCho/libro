public void testReleaseTrigger() {
    ReleaseManager releaseManager = new ReleaseManager();
    releaseManager.prepareRelease("1.2.3");

    boolean releaseTriggered = releaseManager.triggerRelease();

    assertTrue("Release should have been triggered", releaseTriggered);
}

This test assumes the existence of a `ReleaseManager` class with methods `prepareRelease` and `triggerRelease`. The test checks that `triggerRelease` returns `true`, indicating a successful release trigger. Adjust the class and method names as per your actual implementation.
