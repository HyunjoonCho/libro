public void testBitInputStreamOverflow() {

    // The assertion here depends on the expected correct behavior without overflow.
    // For demonstration purposes, let's assume the expected values are known.
    assertEquals(expectedFirstValue, first);

**Note:** Replace `expectedFirstValue`, `expectedSecondValue`, and `expectedThirdValue` with the actual expected values you anticipate if the overflow issue is fixed. This test is designed to verify that the overflow does not occur and that the bits are read correctly.
