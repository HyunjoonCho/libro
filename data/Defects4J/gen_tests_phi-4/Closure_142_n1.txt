This test method sets up an array of arrays and sorts it using a comparator. It checks if the original arrays were modified during the sort, which is the issue observed in Internet Explorer when using Google Closure's compiled output. The test assumes that the original arrays should remain unchanged, which is the expected behavior in browsers other than IE when the threshold is large enough.
