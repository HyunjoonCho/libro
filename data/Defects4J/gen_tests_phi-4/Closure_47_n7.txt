public void testOriginalSourceLineNumbers() {
    // Assuming there is a method getSourceMap() that returns a source map
    SourceMap sourceMap = getSourceMap();

}

This test assumes a `getSourceMap()` method available in your test context that returns a `SourceMap` object, and that `SourceMap` has a method `getOriginalLineNumber(int line)` which retrieves the original line number for a given line. The test checks that the original line number for a 1-based input (line 1) is returned as 0, indicating zero-based indexing.
