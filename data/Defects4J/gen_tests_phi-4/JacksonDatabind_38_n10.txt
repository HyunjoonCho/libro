public void testSimpleTypeConstruct() {
    ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
    JavaType javaType = new SimpleType.construct(List.class);

    // Attempt to handle fields and methods, which should fail or be incomplete
    JsonDeserializer<?> deserializer = objectMapper.getDeserializerFactory().constructCollectionLikeDeserializer(javaType, objectMapper.getDeserializationConfig(), null, null, null);
    
    // Verify that fields and methods are not found
    assertNull(deserializer);
}

This test method attempts to reproduce the issue by using `SimpleType.construct(Class)` to create a `JavaType` for a `List`. It then tries to construct a deserializer using this type, expecting it to fail or be incomplete due to the inability to resolve fields and methods properly. The assertion checks that the deserializer is `null`, indicating that no fields or methods were found.
