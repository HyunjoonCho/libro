public void testClosureRemovesNeededCode() {
    Object test = new Object();
    // Simulate the JavaScript behavior in Java
    // Define a method inside Math that modifies 'test'
    Math.blah = (Object t) -> t.a = 5;

    // Invoke the method
    Math.blah(test);

    // Assert that the side-effect occurred
    assertEquals(5, test.a);
}

Note: This test is conceptual since Java does not directly support JavaScript's closure behavior or modifying `Math`. The test simulates the closure by using a lambda in Java to mimic the side-effect. However, the actual issue described is specific to JavaScript's Closure Compiler, and Java does not have a direct equivalent.
