public void testReleaseProcessTriggered() {
    ReleaseManager releaseManager = new ReleaseManager();
    releaseManager.triggerRelease(125); // Assuming this method triggers the release for a specific issue/PR

    String currentVersion = releaseManager.getCurrentVersion();
    assertTrue("Release for issue #125 should update the version", 
               currentVersion.contains("1.2.3")); // Assuming 1.2.3 is the expected version after release
}

This test assumes:
- There is a `ReleaseManager` class responsible for handling releases.
- `triggerRelease(int issueNumber)` is a method that triggers the release process for a specific issue or pull request.
- `getCurrentVersion()` returns the current version of the software after the release attempt.
