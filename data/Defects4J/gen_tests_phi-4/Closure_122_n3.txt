public void testNonJSDocCommentHandling() {
    String input = "/* @preserve Foo License */\nalert(\"foo\");";
    
    // Simulate the behavior of Closure Compiler or similar tool
    String output = processInput(input);
    
    // Expect warning about non-JSDoc comment with annotations
    String expectedWarning = "stdin:1: WARNING - Parse error. Non-JSDoc comment has annotations. Did you mean to start it with '/\\*\\*'?";

    assertTrue(output.contains(expectedWarning));
    assertTrue(output.contains("alert(\"foo\");"));
}

In this test, `processInput` is a placeholder for the method you would use to simulate the behavior of the Closure Compiler or similar tool that processes the input string. The test checks for the presence of the expected warning and ensures that the `alert("foo");` line is preserved in the output.
