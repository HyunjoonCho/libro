public void testEnumTypeAnnotation() {
    // Simulate the enum definition and compilation behavior
    // Assuming we have a method to simulate the compiler's behavior
    CompilerOutput output = compileWithAdvancedOptimizations(
        "@type {Object}",
        "var NS = {};",
        "@enum {number}",
        "NS.keys = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };",
        "@enum",
        "window['gKEYS'] = NS.keys;"
    );

    // Check if the enum is incorrectly type annotated as 'undefined'
    assertNotEquals("undefined", output.getTypeAnnotation("NS.keys"));
}

**Note:** This test assumes the existence of a `compileWithAdvancedOptimizations` method that simulates the compiler's behavior and returns a `CompilerOutput` object, which provides type annotations. You would need to implement or mock this functionality to run the test.
