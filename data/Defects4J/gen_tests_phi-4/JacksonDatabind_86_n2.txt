public void testMissingPropertiesInRecursiveTypes() throws JsonProcessingException {
    ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
    Base base = new Base();
    Sub sub = new Sub();
    
    // Serialize the Sub instance
    String serialized = objectMapper.writeValueAsString(sub);
    
    // Expected output should include properties from both Base and Sub
    String expected = "{\"base\":1,\"sub\":2}";
    
    assertEquals(expected, serialized);
}

Note: This test assumes that the `Base` and `Sub` classes are properly set up to allow `Sub` to inherit properties from `Base`. You may need to adjust the setup to ensure the inheritance and property inclusion are correctly handled by your serialization library.
