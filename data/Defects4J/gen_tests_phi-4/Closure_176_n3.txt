public void testNullPointerWithTypeDeclaration() {
    MyClass x = null;
    try {
        x.show();
        fail("Expected NullPointerException");
    } catch (NullPointerException e) {
        // Expected exception
    }
}

Explanation:
- We declare a variable `x` of type `MyClass` and initialize it to `null`.
- We attempt to call a method on `x`, which should result in a `NullPointerException`.
- The test expects this exception to be thrown, and it will pass if the exception is caught, indicating the bug is reproduced.
