Note: The actual path `"path/to/directory/with/a/very/long/directory/name/that/should/exceed/100/bytes/when/encoded/utf-8"` should be replaced with a valid path to a directory with a long name in your test environment. This test assumes that `TarUtilities` and its `tar` method are correctly implemented according to the description in the bug report. Adjust the import or method calls as necessary based on your actual class and method names.
