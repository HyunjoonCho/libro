public void testTypeHierarchyAdapter() {
    ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
    String jsonString = "{\"type\":\"Truck\"}";

    try {
        Car car = mapper.readValue(jsonString, Car.class);
        fail("Expected a runtime exception when decoding a Truck as a Car");
    } catch (JsonMappingException e) {
        assertTrue(e.getMessage().contains("Cannot construct instance of"));
    }
}

Note: This test assumes `Car` and `Truck` are subclasses of `Vehicle` and that the `ObjectMapper` is configured with a type hierarchy adapter for `Vehicle`. The `jsonString` represents a JSON object that should be decoded as a `Truck`, which should trigger an exception when attempting to decode it as a `Car`.
