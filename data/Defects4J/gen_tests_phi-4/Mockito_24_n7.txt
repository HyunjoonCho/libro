public void testRawTypeWarning() {
    List rawList = new ArrayList();
    rawList.add("test");
    assertEquals("test", rawList.get(0));
}

In this example, `List` is used as a raw type, which can lead to raw type warnings. The issue can be resolved by specifying the generic type, like `List<String>`.
