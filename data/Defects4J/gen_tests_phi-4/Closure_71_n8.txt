public void testSubclassPrivatePropertyRedeclaration() {
    Foo foo = new Foo();
    SubFoo subFoo = new SubFoo();
    assertEquals(3, foo.x_);
    assertEquals(3, subFoo.x_);
}

Note: This test method assumes that the Java equivalent classes `Foo` and `SubFoo` exist and are structured similarly to the JavaScript code described. The test checks that no error is thrown when `x_` is redeclared as private in the subclass.
