public void testPossibleNpeWithPowerMockito() {
    try {
        PowerMockito.mock(Class.class);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Expecting a NullPointerException here
        assertTrue(e instanceof NullPointerException);
    }
}

This test attempts to mock a `Class` object directly using PowerMockito, which is not supported and should result in a `NullPointerException` due to the inability to create a proxy for `Class`. The test then verifies that the exception is indeed a `NullPointerException`, reproducing the failure described in the bug report.
