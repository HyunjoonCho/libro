public void testRequireCallsProcessingBug() {
    // Assuming ProcessClosurePrimitives has a method processRequireCall for testing
    // and that we have a mock or setup to simulate the environment.

    // Mock or setup the AST and context for the test
    AST ast = setupASTWithInvalidRequireCall();

    // Execute the method that has the bug
    ProcessClosurePrimitives.processRequireCall(ast, new MockContextWithRequiresLevelOn());

    // Verify that the invalid require call is not removed
    assertTrue(ast.containsInvalidRequireCall("invalidSymbol"));
}

**Note:** This code assumes the existence of certain methods and classes (`setupASTWithInvalidRequireCall`, `MockContextWithRequiresLevelOn`, etc.) that would be part of the testing environment. You would need to implement these mocks or setups based on the actual codebase.
