public void testIncompleteReinitializationEventHandling() {
    EventProcessor processor = new EventProcessor();
    Event event1 = new Event("event1");
    Event event2 = new Event("event2");

    processor.register(event1);
    processor.register(event2);

    processor.process(event1); // Suppose this event resets the state
    processor.process(event2); // This event should find its way after complete reinitialization

    assertTrue(event1.isHandled());
    assertTrue(event2.isHandled());
}

This test assumes an `EventProcessor` class that handles events, and each `Event` has an `isHandled()` method to verify if it was processed successfully. The test checks that both events are processed correctly, even when the first event resets the state.
