public void testMockitoTimeoutWithoutJUnit() {
    // Mocking an Observable object
    Observable mockObservable = mock(Observable.class);

    // Perform the verification with timeout
    verify(mockObservable, timeout(500)).countObservers();
}

This test method attempts to reproduce the described failure by using Mockito's `timeout` verification without including JUnit in the classpath. The issue arises because Mockito 1.10.x expects certain JUnit classes for the timeout verification to function correctly. If JUnit is missing, the JVM throws a `VerifyError` or `NoClassDefFoundError`. This test should be run in an environment that mirrors the conditions described, i.e., without JUnit on the classpath, to observe the failure.
