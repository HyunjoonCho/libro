public void testPrototypesDeclaredWithQuotes() {
    // Assuming a hypothetical JavaScript execution environment is set up
    // to run this test, as JUnit is for Java. This is a conceptual example.

    // Simulate the environment setup
    String jsCode = 
        "function MyClass() {}\n" +
        "MyClass.prototype['MyMethod'] = function(a) { this.a = a; }\n" +
        "window['MyClass'] = MyClass;\n" +

    // Execute the JavaScript code
    executeJavaScript(jsCode);

    // Check for the warning in the output
    String output = getJavaScriptWarningOutput();

}

Note: This example assumes a hypothetical setup where JavaScript can be executed and its output captured within a Java testing environment, which is not directly possible with JUnit alone. This would typically require integration with a JavaScript engine or testing framework that supports JavaScript execution.
