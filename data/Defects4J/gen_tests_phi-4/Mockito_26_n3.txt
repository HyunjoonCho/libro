import static org.mockito.MockitoAnnotations.initMocks;

public void testInjectMocksFinalField() {
    MyClass myClass = new MyClass();
    MyDependency myDependency = mock(MyDependency.class);
    
    initMocks(myClass); // Initializes mocks and injects them into final fields
    
    // Test to ensure the final field is injected
    assertNotNull(myClass.myDependency);
}

Make sure to have the following class setup:

public class MyClass {
    @InjectMocks
    private final MyDependency myDependency;
}

This test method will reproduce the failure when `@InjectMocks` fails to inject into a final field with Mockito versions 1.9.0 and above.
