public void testMissingPropertiesFromBaseClass() throws JsonProcessingException {
    ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
    Base base = new Base();
    Sub sub = new Sub();

    // Serialize the Sub class
    String serializedSub = mapper.writeValueAsString(sub);

    // Expected output should include properties from both Base and Sub
    String expected = "{\"base\":1,\"sub\":2}";

    assertEquals(expected, serializedSub);
}

This test method attempts to reproduce the issue by serializing an instance of `Sub` and checking if the serialized JSON includes the properties from the `Base` class as expected.
