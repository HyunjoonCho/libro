public void testIssue114() {
    // Setup the scenario that causes the failure
    // Example: assuming the issue is related to a method `methodUnderTest`
    // Replace with actual setup code
    Object input =...; // Input that causes the failure
    Object expectedOutput =...; // Expected result that was not achieved

    // Call the method that fails
    Object actualOutput = methodUnderTest(input);

    // Assert the failure
    assertNotEquals(expectedOutput, actualOutput);
}

To complete this test method, replace the placeholders with the specific input, expected output, and method call that reproduces the failure described in issue #114. If you can provide more details about the bug, I can help refine this further.
