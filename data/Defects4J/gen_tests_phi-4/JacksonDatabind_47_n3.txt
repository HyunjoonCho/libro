public void testJsonSerializeAsSuperType() throws Exception {
    Foo foo = new Foo();
    ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();

    // This should serialize and then deserialize without error
    String json = mapper.writeValueAsString(foo);
    Foo deserializedFoo = mapper.readValue(json, Foo.class);

    // Assert that the deserialized object is not null
    assertNotNull(deserializedFoo);
}

In this test method, we attempt to serialize and deserialize an instance of `Foo` to check for the `JsonMappingException` described. The exception is expected to be thrown due to the inability to widen the type from `AccessionIdentifier` to `BaseAccessionIdentifier`. The test verifies the failure by attempting to assert that the deserialized object is not null, which should fail due to the exception.
