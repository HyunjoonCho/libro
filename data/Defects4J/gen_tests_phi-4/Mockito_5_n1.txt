public void testMockitoTimeoutWithoutJUnit() {
    // Arrange
    // Create a mock of Observable, which has a method 'countObservers' to be verified.
    Observable mockObservable = mock(Observable.class);

    // Act & Assert
    // Verify that 'countObservers' is called within a specified timeout period.
    // This test reproduces the issue where Mockito 1.10.x requires JUnit classes in the classpath.
    verify(mockObservable, timeout(500)).countObservers();
}

This test method is designed to reproduce the issue described in the bug report. It uses Mockito's `timeout` verification method without having JUnit in the classpath, which should trigger a `VerifyError` or `NoClassDefFoundError` due to Mockito's reliance on JUnit classes for handling certain exceptions.
