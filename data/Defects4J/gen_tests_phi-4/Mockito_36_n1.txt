public void testMockitoRule() {
    // Assuming MockitoJUnit.rule() is the method to be tested for compatibility
    MockitoRule mockitoRule = MockitoJUnit.rule().silent();

    // Create a mock object using the rule
    MyService myServiceMock = mock(MyService.class);

    // Use the mock in a test scenario
    myServiceMock.performAction();

    // Verify that performAction was called
    verify(myServiceMock).performAction();

Note: This assumes `MyService` is a class with a method `performAction()` that you want to mock and verify. Adjust the class and method names as needed for your specific test case.
