public void testTypeCheckingError() {
    Myclass instance = new Myclass();
    instance.test();
    instance.fn(true);
}

class Myclass {
    Myclass() {}

    void fn(boolean success) {}

    void test() {

}

To trigger the error, you would need to ensure that the test framework or compiler you are using can enforce type checking and report the error when `fn()` is called with no arguments. If using a strict mode in JavaScript, this would typically be a runtime error, but in Java, you might need additional setup to check for method signature mismatches.
