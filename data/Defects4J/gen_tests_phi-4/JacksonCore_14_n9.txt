public void testRelaxOwnershipChecks() {
    IOContext context = new IOContext();
    ByteBuffer originalBuffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);
    ByteBuffer newBuffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);

    // Simulate an operation that returns a new buffer with similar size
    ByteBuffer resultBuffer = someIOOperation(context, originalBuffer);

    // Verify that the resultBuffer is not the same as the originalBuffer
    assertNotSame(originalBuffer, resultBuffer);

    // Verify that the resultBuffer has a similar size to the originalBuffer

Note: `someIOOperation` is a placeholder for the actual method being tested. You would need to replace it with the real method that performs the buffer operation.
