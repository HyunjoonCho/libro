}

This test method uses Mockito's `timeout` verification feature. If JUnit is not available on the classpath, running this test should trigger a `VerifyError` or `NoClassDefFoundError` due to the dependency on JUnit classes, as described in the bug report. Make sure to execute this test in an environment where JUnit is not present to observe the failure.
