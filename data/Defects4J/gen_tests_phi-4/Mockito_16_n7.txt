public void testReleaseTrigger() {
    // Simulate the conditions under which a release should be triggered
    ReleaseConfiguration config = new ReleaseConfiguration();
    config.setPullRequestNumber(125);
    config.setMergeStatus(MergeStatus.MERGED);

    // Assuming there's a method to check if a release should be triggered
    boolean shouldTrigger = ReleaseManager.shouldTriggerRelease(config);

    // Assert that the release should have been triggered
    assertTrue("Release should have been triggered for PR #125", shouldTrigger);
}

This test assumes the existence of a `ReleaseConfiguration` class and a `ReleaseManager` with a method `shouldTriggerRelease`. The test checks if the release should trigger under the given conditions, which would help identify if the logic is flawed. Adjust the classes
