public void testExternalPropertyDeserializationFailure() {
    ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();

    String json = "{\"externalId\": \"12345\", \"data\": \"example\"}";

    // Assuming ExternalId and Data are classes that are part of the deserialization issue
    try {
        ExternalIdData deserialized = mapper.readValue(json, ExternalIdData.class);
        assertNotNull("External property should not be null after deserialization", deserialized.getExternalId());
    } catch (Exception e) {
        fail("Exception during deserialization: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}

In this test:

- We create a JSON string that includes an `externalId` property.
- We attempt to deserialize it into an `ExternalIdData` class, which should have an `externalId` property.
- We assert that the `externalId` property is not null after deserialization, which is the expected behavior.
- If deserialization fails or the `externalId` is null, the test will fail, reproducing the issue described.
