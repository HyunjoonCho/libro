public void testIncompleteReinitializationWithEvents() {
    EventHandler handler = new EventHandler();
    Event firstEvent = new Event("first");
    Event secondEvent = new Event("second");

    handler.handleEvent(firstEvent);
    handler.handleEvent(secondEvent);

    assertTrue(handler.canHandleEvent(secondEvent));
    assertEquals("expectedState", handler.getCurrentState());
}

Explanation:
- `EventHandler` is assumed to be the class handling events.
- `Event` is assumed to be a class representing events.
- The test checks if the `secondEvent` can be handled after `firstEvent` and verifies the state after handling both events. Adjust `"expectedState"` to match the expected state after handling both events.
