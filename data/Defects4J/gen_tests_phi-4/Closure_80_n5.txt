public void testIssueUnexpectedExpressionNodeDELPROP() {
    String code = "function x() { return delete a; }";
    
    // Assuming there is a method `compileWithAdvancedCompilation` that simulates 
    // the behavior of the Closure Compiler with advanced compilation enabled.
    try {
        compileWithAdvancedCompilation(code);
        fail("Expected RuntimeException due to unexpected DELPROP node");
    } catch (RuntimeException e) {
        // Ensure the exception message matches the expected compiler error
        assertTrue(e.getMessage().contains("Unexpected expression nodeDELPROP 1"));

Note: This test assumes the existence of a method `compileWithAdvancedCompilation` that mimics the behavior of the Closure Compiler with advanced compilation enabled. You would need to implement or mock this method to simulate the compilation process and verify the error message.
