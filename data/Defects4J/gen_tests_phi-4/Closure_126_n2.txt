Note: Since Java does not have labeled `break` statements that can be used in the same way as JavaScript, this test demonstrates the concept by ensuring that the `finally` block executes and no exception propagates out of the `try-finally` construct. The `fail` method is used to indicate that an exception was not properly handled.
