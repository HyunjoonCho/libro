This test assumes the existence of a `ReleaseManager` class with a `checkReleaseTrigger` method that returns `true` if a release is correctly triggered for a given pull request. The test checks that the release was not triggered for PR125, as described in the bug report. Adjust the class and method names based on your actual implementation.
