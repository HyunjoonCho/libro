public void testArchiveOutputStreamFinishMethod() {
    try (ArchiveOutputStream aos = new MyArchiveOutputStream(createOutputStream())) {
        aos.write("example data".getBytes());
        aos.finish(); // Calling finish() method externally
        aos.close();  // This should internally call finish() again, potentially causing corruption
    } catch (IOException e) {
        fail("IOException should not be thrown when finish() is called externally and then close() is called.");
    }
    
    // Verify the archive is corrupted if finish() is called externally
    // This might require reading the output stream and checking for inconsistencies
}

**Note**: Replace `MyArchiveOutputStream` and `createOutputStream()` with the actual implementation and method used in your context. The test assumes that calling `finish()` externally and then `close()` could lead to corruption, which should be detectable in the output.
