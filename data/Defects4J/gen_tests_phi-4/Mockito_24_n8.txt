public void testRawTypeWarning() {
    List mockedList = mock(List.class); // Use the correct generic type
    mockedList.add("one");
    verify(mockedList).add("one");
}

In the original test, the `mockedList` would have been declared without generics, like this:

List mockedList = mock(List.class);

This would trigger a raw type warning. The test method above shows how it should be corrected by specifying the generic type `List`. The test method itself should not fail when corrected, but it would reproduce the raw type warning if left uncorrected.
