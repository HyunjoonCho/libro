public void testJsoupParseHangs() {
    String bogusInput = "binaryDataHere"; // Replace with actual binary data that causes the hang
    assertDoesNotThrow(() -> {
        Document doc = Jsoup.parse(bogusInput, "", Parser.xmlParser());
    });
}

**Note:** Since the original issue is that the process hangs, the test method attempts to parse the input and checks that no exception is thrown. However, to properly test for a hang, you might need to implement a timeout mechanism or a similar approach to detect the hang in a test environment, as JUnit itself doesn't have built-in support for detecting hangs.
