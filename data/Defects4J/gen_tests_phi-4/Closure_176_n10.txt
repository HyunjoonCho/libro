public void testInitialTypeOfVariableWithVar() {
    // Assuming we have a Java equivalent of MyClass and a way to simulate the behavior
    MyClass x = null;
    try {
        x.show();
        fail("Expected NullPointerException");
    } catch (NullPointerException e) {
        // Expected behavior
    }
}

Note: Since the original issue is in JavaScript with Closure Compiler, this Java test simulates the expected behavior by checking for a `NullPointerException` when calling `show()` on a `null` reference.
