public void testCompilerCrash() {
    String inputCode = "/* Your JavaScript code here from soundmanager2-nodebug.js */";
    CompilerOptions options = new CompilerOptions();
    options.setCompilationLevel(CompilationLevel.SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS);
    
    Compiler compiler = new Compiler();
    compiler.compile(inputCode, options);
    
    // The test will fail if the compiler throws an exception related to index bounds
    // since we are focusing on reproducing the specific error mentioned.
    // Normally, you would check the exception message to confirm the specific error.
}

**Note:** In a real test, you would need to include the actual JavaScript code from `soundmanager2-nodebug.js` and handle exceptions to verify the specific error message. The test assumes the presence of a `Compiler` class with the appropriate methods and options.
