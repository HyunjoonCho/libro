public void testBadTypeInference() {
    assertFalse(test.isMatched(new Double(1.0))); // Passing a Number to trigger the warning
}

This test assumes the existence of `test.isMatched` function and `goog.isFunction`, `goog.isDef`, etc., as described in the bug report. The test is designed to pass a `Double` (a Number object in Java) to `test.isMatched`, which should trigger the warning about accessing the `length` property on a Number, as Numbers do not have a `length` property. The test asserts that `test.isMatched` returns `false`, which is the expected behavior when the input does not match any of the conditions that return early from the function.
