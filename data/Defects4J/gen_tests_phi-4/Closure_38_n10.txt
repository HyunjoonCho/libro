        // Simulate running the script in a JS engine
        // This is a placeholder for the actual JS engine execution
        // Assuming a method `runJavaScript` that evaluates the script

**Note:** The `runJavaScript` method is a placeholder for the actual execution of JavaScript code in a testing environment. You might need to use a library like Rhino or Nashorn (for older Java versions) or GraalVM to execute JavaScript code within a JUnit test. Adjust the test to fit the specific JS engine you're using.
