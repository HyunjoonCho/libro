public void testInterfaceToConstructorConversion() {
    // Simulate the setup from the bug report
    interface OtherType {}
    
    class MyType implements OtherType {
        public MyType() {
            // Force type assignment that would cause recursion
            this.x = (MyType) new Object();
        }
        
        @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
        MyType x;
    }

    // Instantiate to trigger the stack overflow error
    new MyType();
}

This test simulates the described scenario by creating a Java class hierarchy that mimics the JavaScript behavior described in the bug report. The cycle in the type assignment should induce a stack overflow during execution.
