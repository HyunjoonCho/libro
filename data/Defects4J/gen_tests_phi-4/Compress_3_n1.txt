public void testArchiveOutputStreamFinishMethod() {
    // Assuming ArchiveOutputStream is a stubbed or mocked class in this context
    ArchiveOutputStream archiveOutputStream = new ArchiveOutputStream();

    try {
        archiveOutputStream.finish(); // Attempt to call finish externally
        archiveOutputStream.close();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // Expecting an exception if calling finish() externally is unsafe
        assertNotNull(e);
    }

    // Assert the state of the archive or any other expected outcome
    // This part would depend on what the finish() method is supposed to do
    // For example, checking if the archive is in a consistent state
    // assertTrue(archiveOutputStream.isConsistent());
}

Note: This test assumes that `ArchiveOutputStream` is a class that can be instantiated and manipulated in this manner, and that calling `finish()` externally should lead to an exception or an inconsistent state. Adjust the assertions based on the actual behavior and outcomes expected from calling `finish()` externally.
