public void testRelaxOwnershipChecks() {
    IOContext ioContext = new IOContext();
    ByteBuffer originalBuffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);
    ByteBuffer newBuffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(512); // Different buffer with similar capacity

    // Simulate the method that checks buffer ownership and size
    boolean result = ioContext.checkBufferOwnership(originalBuffer, newBuffer);

}

Note: This test assumes that the `checkBufferOwnership` method exists in `IOContext` and is responsible for checking buffer ownership and size. Adjust the method name and logic as per the actual implementation.
