public void testReleaseTriggerOnPullRequest() {
    // Setup mock environment and conditions for PR #125
    PullRequest pr = new PullRequest(125, true); // Assuming `true` indicates conditions met for release
    ReleaseManager releaseManager = new ReleaseManager();

    // Simulate the pull request merging
    releaseManager.onMerge(pr);

    // Verify that a release was triggered
    assertTrue(releaseManager.isReleaseTriggered());
}

This is a hypothetical test assuming you have a `ReleaseManager` class that handles release logic and a `PullRequest` class representing a pull request. The test checks if merging a pull request with certain conditions triggers a release. Adjust the classes and logic according to your actual implementation.
