This test method attempts to reproduce the described optimization issue in a language like Java. However, it's important to note that the behavior is specific to JavaScript and Closure Compiler optimizations, which cannot be directly replicated in Java as Java's optimization processes differ. The test method outlines the logic in Java, but the optimization issue itself is not applicable outside the JavaScript context.
