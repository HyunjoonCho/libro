public void testTypeRefiningOfThisRaisesException() {
    try {
        // Simulating the scenario where 'this' is directly used in a function call
        // that triggers type refining, leading to IllegalArgumentException
        if (goog.isFunction(this)) {
            // The expectation is for normal compilation, but it raises an exception
        }

}

Note: This test method simulates the scenario described in the bug report. The actual test might require a mock or stub for `goog.isFunction` to simulate the behavior accurately, as the method and its behavior are not standard Java and would depend on the specific implementation details of the `goog` library.
