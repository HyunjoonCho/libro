public void testPoissonDistributionImplConstructor() {

    // The test would fail if the constructor's behavior is altered 
    // due to the order of operations or if 'z' is modified unexpectedly.
    assertEquals(5.0, distribution.getMean(), 0.0);
    // Assuming'setNormal' modifies 'z' which should be avoided
    // Further assertions can be added to check if 'z' remains unmodified

Note: This test assumes there are `getMean()` method and that the `NormalDistribution` object should not be modified by the constructor. Adjustments may be needed based on the actual implementation details of `PoissonDistributionImpl` and `NormalDistribution`.
