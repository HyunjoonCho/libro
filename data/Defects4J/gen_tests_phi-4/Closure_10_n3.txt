public void testIssueWrongCodeGeneratedWithMixedTypes() {
    double result = (Math.random() > 0.5? "1" : 2) + 3 + 4;

Note: This test assumes that the behavior described in the bug report is being simulated in a Java context. In Java, the ternary operator will promote the `String` to a `Number`, resulting in numerical addition. The test checks if the result is numeric (indicating a bug) and returns an error message if so. In an actual Java environment, the behavior would differ from JavaScript's, as Java does not automatically convert strings to numbers in mixed-type expressions.
