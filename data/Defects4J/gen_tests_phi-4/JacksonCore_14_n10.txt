public void testRelaxOwnershipChecks() {
    IOContext ioContext = new IOContext();
    ByteBuffer originalBuffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);
    ByteBuffer newBuffer = ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(1024);

    // Simulate an operation that should only require similar size, not necessarily the same buffer
    boolean result = ioContext.checkBuffer(originalBuffer, newBuffer);

    assertFalse(result);  // Expecting the check to fail with the current implementation
}

Note: This assumes the existence of an `IOContext` class with a `checkBuffer` method that performs the ownership check, and that it returns `false` when the buffer sizes are similar but the buffers are not the same. Adjust the method names and logic to fit the actual implementation details you have.
