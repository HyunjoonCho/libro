**Note:** This test assumes that there is a resource file named `tar-with-big-user-id.tar` in the test resources directory that contains the problematic TAR entry. The resource file should be crafted to reproduce the specific condition described in the bug report, with a user ID that causes the `IllegalArgumentException`.
