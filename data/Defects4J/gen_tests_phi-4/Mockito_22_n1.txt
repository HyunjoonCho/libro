public void testDeepStubsGenericMethod() throws Exception {
    I i = mock(I.class, RETURNS_DEEP_STUBS);

    // Attempt to stub the method with deep stubs, which should cause a ClassCastException

}

This test method demonstrates the `ClassCastException` that occurs when using Mockito's `RETURNS_DEEP_STUBS` with a generic method that returns a generic type, as described in the bug report.
