public void testCoreUnionOperationSorting() {
    // Assume 'evaluateXPath' is a method that evaluates the XPath expression on the provided document.
    //'sourceDocument' is the XML document loaded into a DOM or similar structure.
    String result = evaluateXPath(sourceDocument, "/MAIN/B | /MAIN/A");
    assertEquals("avalue", result);
}

**Note**: In this test method, `evaluateXPath` is a placeholder for the actual method used to evaluate XPath expressions on the provided document. The `sourceDocument` should be set up to represent the XML structure given in the bug report. The test checks whether the result of the XPath expression matches the expected output when the nodes are sorted according to document order.
