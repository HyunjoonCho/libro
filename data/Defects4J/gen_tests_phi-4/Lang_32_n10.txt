public void testThreadLocalMemoryLeak() {
    ToStringStyle style = new ToStringStyle();
    try {
        // Simulate the use of ToStringStyle in an environment where it triggers the creation of a ThreadLocal
        Object obj = new Object();
        String result = org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.ToStringBuilder.reflectionToString(obj, style);
        
        // Verify that the result is generated correctly
        assertNotNull(result);
    } finally {
        // Cleanup if possible, although the issue is with the lack of cleanup in the library
        ToStringStyle.removeThreadLocal();
    }
}

Note: The `removeThreadLocal()` method is hypothetical in this context since the actual library might not provide such a method. This test assumes that there is a way to trigger and verify the memory leak, and that any cleanup is done in the `finally` block if possible.
