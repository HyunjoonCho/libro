public void testAixNativeTarWithSymlinks() throws IOException {
    // Create a tar file with a symlink on AIX using the native tar utility
    // This is a placeholder for the actual tar file creation, which cannot be done in Java
    // Assume the tar file is created and named 'test.tar' in the current directory

    TarArchiveInputStream tarInputStream = new TarArchiveInputStream(new FileInputStream("test.tar"));
    TarArchiveEntry entry;
    while ((entry = tarInputStream.getNextTarEntry())!= null) {
        // The test will fail if it reaches here without throwing an IOException
        // because the issue is that an IOException is expected when reading the symlink
    }
    // If no exception is thrown, the test should fail
    fail("Expected IOException when reading a symlink in tar file created by AIX native tar");
}

**Note:** This test assumes that the tar file `test.tar` is created on an AIX system using the native tar utility and contains a symlink. The test will pass if an `IOException` is thrown, which is the expected behavior described in the bug report.
