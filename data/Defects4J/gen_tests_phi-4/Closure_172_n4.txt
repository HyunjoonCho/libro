public void testPrototypeTypeInference() {
    Object a = new Object();
    Object b = new Object();

    // Simulating the JavaScript behavior in Java
    a = new Object() {}; // Equivalent to setting prototype to an object
    b = new Object() {}; // Equivalent to setting prototype to a function

    // In Java, we expect no error since prototypes are not directly assignable
    // The test is to ensure no exception is thrown, indicating the inference issue in JS
    assertEquals(Object.class, a.getClass());
    assertEquals(Object.class, b.getClass());
}

Note: The test above is adapted to Java, as Java does not have direct prototypes like JavaScript. The test checks that no exceptions are thrown, simulating the expected behavior.
