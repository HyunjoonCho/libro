public void testSourceMapLineNumbers() {
    SourceMap sourceMap = generateSourceMap();
    int originalLineNumber = sourceMap.getOriginalLineNumber(1); // Expected line number should be 0
    assertEquals(0, originalLineNumber);
}

In this test, we assume there's a `generateSourceMap()` method that produces a `SourceMap` object. The test checks if the original line number for a one-based input (1) returns zero, which is the expected behavior according to the bug report.
