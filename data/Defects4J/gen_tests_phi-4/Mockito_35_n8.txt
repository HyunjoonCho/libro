public void testPossibleNpeExceptionWhenClassCannotBeMocked() {
    try {
        PowerMockito.mock(MyUnmockableClass.class);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Expected: NullPointerException should be caught here due to inability to mock MyUnmockableClass
        assertTrue(e.getCause() instanceof NullPointerException);
    }
}

In this test, replace `MyUnmockableClass` with the actual class that cannot be mocked, which is causing the `NullPointerException`. The test ensures that the exception is caught and verifies that the cause is indeed a `NullPointerException`.
