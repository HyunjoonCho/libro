public void testCombiningTemporaryStringsOverOptimized() {
    // Assuming sgxColorRGBA and the methods sgxFloor, A are defined elsewhere
    sgxColorRGBA color = new sgxColorRGBA(0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f);
    
    // Expected output: "7f7f7f7f"
    String expectedHex = "7f7f7f7f";

    String resultHex = color.asHex();

    assertEquals(expectedHex, resultHex);
}

**Explanation:**

- The test method `testCombiningTemporaryStringsOverOptimized` simulates the described bug by using an instance of `sgxColorRGBA` with RGBA values set to 0.5, which should convert to "7f" in hexadecimal for each channel.
- The expected output is "7f7f7f7f" when all channels are combined.
- The test asserts that the result from `asHex()` matches the expected hexadecimal string.
- This test should reproduce the issue when the code is optimized in a large
