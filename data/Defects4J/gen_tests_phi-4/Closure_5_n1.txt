public void testDeleteStatementBehavior() {
    // Simulate the JavaScript environment with a custom object
    Object foo = new Object();
    Object bar = new Object();
    foo = bar; // Assign bar to foo

    // Log the initial state
    System.out.println("Before delete: " + foo);

    // Attempt to delete 'bar' from 'foo' (simulated by setting to null)
    foo = null;

    // Log the state after 'delete' operation
    System.out.println("After delete: " + foo);

    // Assert that 'foo' is null after the deletion
    assertNull("foo should be null after delete operation", foo);
}

This test simulates the behavior described in the bug report by manually setting the object to `null` to mimic the deletion, as Java does not have a `delete` keyword. It then checks to ensure that the object is `null` after the deletion operation.
