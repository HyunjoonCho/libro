public void testSetEnrollmentCommandWithUnEnrollmentWithNull() {
    Whitebox.invokeMethod(erxProviderManager, "setCommand", Provider.class, null, retait, mail);
}

To reproduce the failure, ensure that `erxProviderManager`, `Provider.class`, `retait`, and `mail` are properly initialized in your test setup, with `Provider.class` being the correct type expected by the method.
