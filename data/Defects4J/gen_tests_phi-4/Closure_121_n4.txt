public void testOverzealousOptimizationConfusesVariables() {
    float uid = 0;
    function reset() {
        uid = (float) Math.random();
    }

    function doStuff() {
        reset();
        float _uid = uid;

        if (uid < 0.5) {
            doStuff();
        }

        if (_uid!= uid) {
            fail("reset() was called");
        }
    }

    doStuff();
}

Note: Since Java doesn't have a direct translation for JavaScript's `Math.random()` returning a float in the range [0, 1), I've cast it to `float` to mimic the behavior. The test will throw an exception if the condition is met, indicating the failure scenario.
