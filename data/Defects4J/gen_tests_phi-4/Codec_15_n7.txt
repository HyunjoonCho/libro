public void testHWRuleInSoundex() {
    assertEquals("S523", Soundex.getSoundex("Shannon"));
    assertEquals("S524", Soundex.getSoundex("Shaun"));
}

This test checks that the Soundex algorithm correctly handles cases where a consonant is preceded by an 'H' or 'W', ensuring that the second consonant is not encoded when separated by such characters.
