public void testDelegatingMethodEquals() {
    Mock mock = mock(Mock.class);
    Invocation invocation = new Invocation(mock, "methodName", new Object[]{});

    CustomVerificationMode customVerification = new CustomVerificationMode();
    DelegatingMethod delegatingMethod = new DelegatingMethod(invocation, customVerification);

    assertTrue(delegatingMethod.equals(invocation));
}

This test assumes you have a `CustomVerificationMode` and `DelegatingMethod` class that extends or uses `VerificationMode`. The test checks if the `equals` method correctly identifies an `Invocation` as equal to itself when wrapped in a `DelegatingMethod`. Adjust the class names and method signatures as needed based on your actual implementation.
