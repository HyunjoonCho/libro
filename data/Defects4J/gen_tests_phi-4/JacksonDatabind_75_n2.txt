public void testJsonFormatShapeNumberIntOnEnum() throws JsonProcessingException {
    ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
    Foo foo = new Foo(Color.GREEN);

    // Expected to serialize Color as number, but it serializes as string instead
    String result = mapper.writeValueAsString(foo);
    assertEquals("{\"color\":\"GREEN\"}", result);
}

Note: In this test, the expected behavior is to serialize the `Color` enum as a string, which reflects the current behavior in version 2.8 as described in the bug report.
