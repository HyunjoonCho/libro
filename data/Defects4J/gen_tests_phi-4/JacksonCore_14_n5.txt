public void testBufferOwnershipRelaxation() {
    IOContext context = new IOContext();
    ByteBuffer originalBuffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);
    ByteBuffer newBuffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(512);
    
    context.checkBufferOwnership(originalBuffer, newBuffer);
    
    // Expect no exception to be thrown, indicating ownership check is relaxed
}

Note: This assumes there is a `checkBufferOwnership` method in the `IOContext` class that would throw an exception if the check fails. This test will pass if no exception is thrown, indicating the relaxation is working as expected.
