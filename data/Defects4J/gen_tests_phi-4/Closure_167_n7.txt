public void testInvalidPropertyNotErroringInForLoopInPrototypeFunction() {
    // Assuming ns and Thing are defined somewhere in the test context
    ns.Thing thing = new ns.Thing();
    thing.subthing = new ns.SubThing();
    thing.subthing.prop = 3; // Setting a valid property

    ns.MyClass myClassInstance = new ns.MyClass(thing);

    // This should not throw an exception, even though `subthing.noprop` is invalid
    myClassInstance.doIt();
}

Note: This test assumes that `ns.Thing` and `ns.SubThing` are defined and that `myClassInstance.doIt()` does not throw an exception when `subthing.noprop` is accessed, as described in the bug report. The test will pass if no exception is thrown, reproducing the bug.
