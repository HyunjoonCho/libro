This test assumes you have access to or can mock the `NamedType`, `RecordType`, and `ProxyObjectType` classes and their methods. The test sets up the scenario described and expects a `ClassCastException` to be thrown during the `checkType()` method call. Adjust the method and class names as needed to fit your actual codebase.
