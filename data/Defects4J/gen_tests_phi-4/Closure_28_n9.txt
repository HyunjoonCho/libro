public void testClosureCompilerInlining() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 25; i++) {
        if (!f()) {

**Note:** This test method is designed to simulate the behavior described in the bug report. In a real Java environment, inlining behavior would be observed through performance analysis rather than direct output, as Java does not have a built-in mechanism like Closure Compiler's `@compilation_level` annotations.
