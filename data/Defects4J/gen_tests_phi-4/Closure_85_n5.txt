    // Assuming `compileScript` is a method that compiles the script and throws an exception on error
    assertThrows(RuntimeException.class, () -> {
        compileScript(script);

Note: The `compileScript` method is assumed to simulate the behavior of the compiler that throws a `RuntimeException` when the `break;` statement is encountered in the switch. You would need to implement this method to mimic the compiler's behavior for the test to be meaningful.
