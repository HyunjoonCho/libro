public void testPrototypesWithQuotesWarning() {
    // Simulating the JavaScript environment setup
    MyClass myClassInstance = new MyClass();
    myClassInstance.MyMethod(42);

    // Verify the behavior is consistent with the expected prototype method
    assertEquals(42, myClassInstance.getA2());
}

// Assuming MyClass and MyParent are defined in Java as follows:

class MyClass extends MyParent {
    public int a2;

    public void MyMethod(int a) {
        this.a2 = a;
    }
}

interface MyParent {
    void MyMethod(int a);
}

Note: This Java code simulates the behavior of the JavaScript prototype setup and method implementation. The actual warning would be specific to the JavaScript environment and its compiler (e.g., Google Closure Compiler), which cannot be directly tested with JUnit.
