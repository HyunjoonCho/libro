public void testRemoveIgnoreCaseConcurrentModificationException() {
    // Assuming 'element' is an instance of a class that has a select method returning an object that has 'first' method
    // which further allows chaining of'removeAttr' methods.
    try {
        element.select("abc").first().removeAttr("attr1").removeAttr("attr2");
        fail("Expected ConcurrentModificationException");
    } catch (ConcurrentModificationException e) {
        // Expected exception caught
    }
}

Note: The above test assumes that `element` is set up within the test class or test suite. The test checks for the `ConcurrentModificationException` and fails the test if it is not thrown, as the bug report indicates this exception is expected to occur under the given conditions. Adjustments might be needed based on the actual implementation details of the classes and methods involved.
