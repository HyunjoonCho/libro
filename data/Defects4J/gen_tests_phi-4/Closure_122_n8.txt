    String expectedWarning = "stdin:1: WARNING - Parse error. Non-JSDoc comment has annotations. Did you mean to start it with '/\\*\\*'?";

    // Simulate the processing of the input
    String output = processInput(input);

**Note:** The `processInput` method is a placeholder for the actual logic that processes the input as described in the bug report. You will need to implement or simulate this logic to reproduce the behavior accurately.
