public void testFixProposalFor114() {
    // Set up the scenario that was failing before the fix
    // Example: Assume the bug was related to incorrect calculation or behavior
    // Replace with actual setup code related to the bug

    // Perform the action that was causing the bug
    // Example: Call the method or use the feature that was failing
    // Replace with actual code that triggers the bug

    // Assert the expected correct behavior after the fix
    // Example: Verify the output or state is now as expected
    // Replace with actual assertions that confirm the fix
    assertEquals(expectedValue, actualValue);
}

To create a specific test, you would need to know the exact nature of the bug and the expected behavior after the fix. If you have more details about the bug or the context, I can help refine this test method further
