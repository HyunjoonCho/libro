Note: The test assumes the presence of a `C3P0ConnectionPool` and `C3P0Statement` class, which are part of the c3p0 library. The test attempts to reproduce the failure by executing a query that exploits the default typing issue. The `fail` method is used to ensure the test fails if no exception is thrown.
