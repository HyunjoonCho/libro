public void testIncompleteReinitialization() {
    EventTracker tracker = new EventTracker();

    // Simulate two events occurring in the same step
    Event event1 = new Event("Event1");
    Event event2 = new Event("Event2");

    // Accept the first event and trigger reinitialization
    tracker.acceptEvent(event1);

    // Attempt to accept the second event
    boolean event2Handled = tracker.acceptEvent(event2);

    // Assert that the second event was not handled due to incomplete reinitialization
    assertFalse(event2Handled);
}

In this example, `EventTracker` is a hypothetical class that manages event handling. The test checks that after accepting the first event, the second event cannot be handled properly, indicating incomplete reinitialization. You would need to adapt this to fit the actual classes and methods used in your codebase.
