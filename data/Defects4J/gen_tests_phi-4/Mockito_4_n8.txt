public void testClassCastException() {
    EasyMockSupport support = new EasyMockSupport();
    MyMock mock = new MyMock();
    EasyMock.expect(mock.someMethod()).andReturn("result");
    EasyMock.replay(mock);

    // This is where the exception is expected to be thrown
    support.verify(mock);

    // This line will trigger the exception if not handled
    EasyMock.verifyZeroInteractions(mock);
}

Note: You might need to adjust the mock and method names according to your actual codebase. The test is designed to reproduce the `ClassCastException` by using `verifyZeroInteractions` after a mock with a default answer has been set up and replayed.
