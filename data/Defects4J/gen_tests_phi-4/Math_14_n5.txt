public void testLargeNumberOfWeights() {
    int largeNumber = 41200;
    double[] weights = new double[largeNumber];
    for (int i = 0; i < largeNumber; i++) {
        weights[i] = 1.0; // Assigning example weights
    }
    
    // Assuming we have a method to create a matrix for optimization
    try {
        Matrix createFullMatrix(double[] weights);
        Matrix matrix = createFullMatrix(weights);
        assertNotNull(matrix); // Ensure the matrix is not null
    } catch (OutOfMemoryError e) {
        assertTrue(true); // Expected failure due to memory exhaustion
    }
}

**Note:** This test expects the method `createFullMatrix` to be part of the codebase, which is supposed to create the matrix from the weights. The test checks for an `OutOfMemoryError`, which is expected given the problem description.
