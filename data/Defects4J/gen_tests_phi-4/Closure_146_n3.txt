public void testBadTypeInference() {
    // This test replicates the behavior described in the bug report
    // using Java as a proxy to demonstrate the issue with type inference.

    // Define a function g that expects a String
    java.util.function.Consumer<String> g = (String x) -> {};

    // Define a function f that uses a check against 'undefined' which is analogous to `null` in Java
    java.util.function.Consumer<Object> f = (Object x) -> {
        if (x!= null) {
            g.accept(x.toString());
        }
    };

    // Test with null input, which is the equivalent of 'undefined' in JavaScript
    f.accept(null);

    // If the code does not throw an exception, the test passes
    // This test is designed to ensure that passing 'null' does not cause an exception,
    // as the bug report suggests the condition should always evaluate to false.
}

In this Java test method, we're simulating the behavior described in the bug report by handling `null` as equivalent to `undefined` in JavaScript, and checking that the condition `x!= null` correctly prevents the invocation of `g` when `x` is `null`.
