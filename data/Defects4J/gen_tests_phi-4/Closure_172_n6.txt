public void testPrototypeTypeInference() {
    // Reproduce the issue in Java by simulating the behavior with a similar logic
    class TestClass {
        Object prototype;
    }

    TestClass testInstance = new TestClass();
    
    // Simulating the incorrect type assignment
    testInstance.prototype = "___proto"; // Expected: no issue
    testInstance.prototype = new java.lang.Runnable() {}; // Expected: should cause an error

    // Check the types to see if the error is reproduced
    assert testInstance.prototype instanceof String; // No error expected
    assert!(testInstance.prototype instanceof Runnable); // Error expected as per the bug report
}

Note: This Java test attempts to simulate the behavior described in the bug report by using type assertions to check the inferred type of the `prototype` property. Java does not have a direct equivalent to JavaScript's `prototype` property, so this test uses class instances and type assertions to emulate the behavior.
