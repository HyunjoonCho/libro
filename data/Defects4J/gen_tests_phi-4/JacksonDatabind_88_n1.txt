public void testMissingTypeChecks() {
    JavaType baseType = objectMapper.getTypeFactory().constructType(Base.class);
    JavaType derivedType = objectMapper.getTypeFactory().constructType(Derived.class);

    // Simulate polymorphic type handling
    objectMapper.registerSubtypes(new SubtypeResolver.BaseSubtypeResolver(Derived.class, "derived"));

    // Attempt to use a derived type where a base type is expected

}

**Explanation:**

- `baseType` and `derivedType` are used to simulate the polymorphic type handling.
- `registerSubtypes` is used to register `Derived.class` as a subtype of `Base.class`.
- The test attempts to deserialize JSON with a type ID `"derived"` into a `Base` type.
- The assertion checks if the deserialized object is incorrectly allowed to be a `Derived` instance, which should not happen if proper type checks are enforced.
