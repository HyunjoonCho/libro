public void testIssue114() {
    // Assuming the bug involved incorrect behavior with a specific input
    String input = "someInputThatCausedFailure";
    Object expectedOutput = "expectedOutputAfterFix";

    // Assuming there's a class and method related to the issue
    Object actualOutput = FaultyClass.someMethodRelatedToIssue(input);

    // This assertion would have failed before the fix
    assertEquals(expectedOutput, actualOutput);
}

In this example, replace `FaultyClass.someMethodRelatedToIssue` with the actual class and method that was causing the issue, and adjust `input` and `expectedOutput` to match the specific conditions described in the bug report.
