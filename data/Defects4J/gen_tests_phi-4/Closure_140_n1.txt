public void testGoogleCommonLoaderExtern() {
    try {
        Class.forName("com.google.common.base.Preconditions");

    }
}

This test attempts to load a class from the Guava library. If the loader extern is misconfigured, it should throw a `ClassNotFoundException`, which the test expects. If the class is found, the test fails, indicating the extern is not causing the expected failure.
