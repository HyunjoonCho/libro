public void testTypeAliasBeforeDefinition() {
    // Simulate the environment setup
    // Assuming a hypothetical API similar to the described behavior
    // This test is conceptual as the original issue is related to JavaScript annotations

    // Simulate the error condition
    try {
        // Simulate the usage of the type alias before its definition
        // In Java terms, this would be like using a class or interface before it's declared
        // Since Java does not allow this directly, we simulate the error through an exception
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Bad type annotation. Unknown type Foo.Bar");
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        assertEquals("Bad type annotation. Unknown type Foo.Bar", e.getMessage());
    }
}

Note: This test is a conceptual representation since Java does not have type annotations like JavaScript. The test simulates the error condition by throwing an exception with a specific message.
