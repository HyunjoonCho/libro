public void testMultiValuedVariableEquality() {
    String[] values = {"a", "b"};

In this test, `Variable` is assumed to be a class that has been defined elsewhere in the codebase, and it should correctly handle equality checks for multi-valued variables according to the specification. The test checks that the variable `d` is considered equal to both "a" and "b", but not to "c".
