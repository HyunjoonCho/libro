public void testLocallyDeclaredGenericType() {
    Something something = new Something();
    Ruleform entity = new Ruleform() {}; // Assuming Ruleform is an abstract class/interface

    something.setEntity(entity);
    Ruleform deserializedEntity = something.getEntity();

    assertSame(entity, deserializedEntity);
}

In this test, the failure would occur if the deserialization process does not correctly handle the locally declared generic type `T`. The test checks if the entity set and retrieved from `Something` is the same, indicating that the generic type handling is correct.
