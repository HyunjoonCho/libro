public void testFrequencyGetPctIssue() {
    Frequency frequency = new Frequency();

    // Assuming the expected behavior is to get the actual percentage for "A", not cumulative.

Note: This test assumes that `getPct("A")` should return 66.67% for the input data provided, reflecting the correct percentage calculation rather than a cumulative one. Adjust the `assertEquals` values based on the actual expected behavior of `getPct(Comparable)`.
