**Note:** The method `compileWithAdvancedOptimizations` would have to simulate the behavior of the Java compilation step described in the bug report. This method is hypothetical and would need to be implemented to actually compile JavaScript code, mimicking the behavior of the described Java compiler invocation. The test checks that the output JavaScript matches the expected output, which preserves the semantics of the original input by avoiding re-evaluation of `obj['prop']` after `modifiesProp(obj)`.
