public void testProcessClosurePrimitivesFlag() {
    // Assuming there's a method compileFile that accepts the flag as a parameter
    // and returns a boolean indicating whether primitives were processed

    // Step 1: Compile with "--process_closure_primitives false"
    boolean resultFalse = compileFile("--process_closure_primitives false");
    assertFalse("Primitives should not be processed with flag set to false", resultFalse);

    // Step 2: Compile with default "--process_closure_primitives true"
    boolean resultTrue = compileFile("--process_closure_primitives true");
    assertTrue("Primitives should be processed with default flag", resultTrue);
}

Note: The `compileFile` method is assumed to be a part of your test setup that simulates the compilation process and checks if primitives are processed. You will need to implement this method based on your actual compilation logic.
