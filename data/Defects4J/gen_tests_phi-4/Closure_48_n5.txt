This test method simulates the behavior described in the bug report by creating a Java class that mirrors the JavaScript class structure. It attempts to call the `fn` method before and after replacing it with a stub, expecting an error due to the type mismatch. The test verifies that the error is correctly reported when `fn` is called after being replaced.
