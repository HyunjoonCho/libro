public void testIssue114() {
    // Hypothetical setup that might have caused the failure
    SomeClass instance = new SomeClass();
    instance.setSomeParameter("boundaryValue");

    // Call the method that was failing
    boolean result = instance.someMethod();

    // Assert the expected behavior
    assertFalse(result, "Expected false due to unhandled edge case in someMethod");
}

This example assumes a method that fails under certain conditions, such as boundary values. Adjust the test to match the specific method and conditions related to the bug.
