public void testDeleteStatementIgnored() {
    // Simulate the JavaScript behavior in Java
    class CompilerTest {
        public void testDelete() {
            Object foo = new Object();
            Object ref = foo;  // initially referring to foo
            System.out.println(ref);  // should print something like [Ljava.lang.Object;@hashcode
            ref = null;  // simulate delete by setting to null
            System.out.println(ref);  // should print null
        }
    }

    CompilerTest testInstance = new CompilerTest();
    testInstance.testDelete();

    // Expected behavior: The first print should be a non-null object reference,
    // and the second print should be null since the reference is effectively "deleted".
}

Note: This test method simulates the described behavior in Java by using `null` to mimic the "delete" operation, as Java does not have a direct equivalent to JavaScript's `delete`. The test checks that assigning `null` to `ref` results in the expected output.
