This test method simulates the behavior described in the bug report by using Java's type system and assertions to replicate the incorrect type inference. The first assertion checks that assigning a string works as expected, while the second assertion verifies the type mismatch when attempting to assign a functional interface (simulating a function) to a property expected to be a string.
