public void testLendsAnnotation() {
    // Simulate the environment where the class is not defined beforehand
    // Assume makeClass is a utility method that should define the class
    // but is called after @lends annotation usage in this scenario.

    // This test would be more conceptual since JUnit is for Java, not JavaScript.
    // However, we can simulate the failure by trying to use a class before it's defined.

    try {
        // Attempt to use a class before it's defined
        Person person = new Person();
        fail("Expected compile error due to @lends annotation misuse.");
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Expected behavior: catch the exception due to the class not being defined
    }
}

Note: This test is conceptual as JUnit is for Java, and the issue pertains to JavaScript. The test simulates the failure by attempting to use a class before it's defined, which should raise an exception.
