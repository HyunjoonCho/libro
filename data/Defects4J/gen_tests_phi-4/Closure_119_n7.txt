    // Since the bug report describes behavior in a JavaScript context with Closure Compiler,

    // and no JSC_UNDEFINED_NAME warning is generated.
    // This test will pass if no exception is thrown by the code itself.
}

This test method attempts to catch an exception in a similar manner to the described JavaScript code, ensuring that `e` is defined within the catch block. Since the issue is about warnings in a JavaScript environment, the Java test ensures that the equivalent code does not result in any exceptions, which would indicate a similar problem.
