public void testSwfObjectUrlEncode() {
    String input = "\"<>.;\"";
    String expected = encodeURIComponent(input); // Assuming encodeURIComponent is a method that encodes input
    String result = urlEncodeIfNecessary(input);
    assertEquals(expected, result);
}

*Note: The function `encodeURIComponent` used in the test is assumed to be a placeholder representing the correct URL encoding logic, as Java does not natively provide this function. You would need to implement or import this logic for the test to work correctly.*
