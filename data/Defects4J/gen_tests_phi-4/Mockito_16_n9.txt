public void testReleaseTriggerOnPullRequestMerge() {
    // Arrange
    PullRequest pr = new PullRequest();
    pr.setId(125);
    pr.setMerged(true);
    ReleaseManager releaseManager = new ReleaseManager();

    // Act
    releaseManager.checkAndTriggerRelease(pr);

    // Assert
    assertTrue(releaseManager.wasReleaseTriggered());
}

In this example, `PullRequest` is a hypothetical class representing a pull request, and `ReleaseManager` is a class responsible for handling releases. The test checks if the release was triggered when a pull request is merged. Adjust the classes and methods according to your actual implementation.
