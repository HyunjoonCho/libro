public void testCompilerCrashWithNonStringProvide() {
    // Simulate the situation by attempting to provide a non-string identifier
    // Note: This test is conceptual as actual invocation would require a JS compiler
    // and this test is meant to reproduce the setup that leads to the error.

    String jsCode = "goog.provide(mine.Spike);";
    
    // Assuming the existence of a method compileJavaScriptCode that compiles JS code
    // and throws a RuntimeException if there's a compiler error, mimicking the described behavior.
    try {
        compileJavaScriptCode(jsCode);
        fail("Expected RuntimeException due to non-string goog.provide usage");
    } catch (RuntimeException e) {
        assertTrue(e.getMessage().contains("is not a string node"));
    }
}

**Note:** This test is conceptual because it involves invoking a JavaScript compiler from Java, which is not directly possible without additional tools or setup. The test assumes a hypothetical method `compileJavaScriptCode` that would handle the compilation and throw an exception as described in the bug report. In a real-world scenario, you would need to use a JavaScript execution environment or compiler API that can be tested in Java.
