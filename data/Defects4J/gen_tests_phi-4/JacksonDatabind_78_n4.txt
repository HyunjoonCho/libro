public void testJacksonDeserializerVulnerability() {
    ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
    // Enabling default typing to simulate the vulnerable configuration
    mapper.activateDefaultTyping(
        ObjectMapper.DefaultTyping.NON_FINAL,
        JsonTypeInfo.As.PROPERTY
    );

    // Vulnerable JSON input
    String json = "{\"type\":\"com.example.class\",\"value\":\"maliciousContent\"}";

    try {
        // Attempt to deserialize without adequate security measures
        Object obj = mapper.readValue(json, Object.class);
        // If no exception is thrown, the test passes, which is incorrect
        fail("Expected deserialization to fail due to security vulnerability.");
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // The test passes if an exception is caught
    }
}

This test method attempts to reproduce the failure by enabling default typing in a way that could lead to security vulnerabilities, as described in the CVE-2017-7525. It uses a sample JSON input that would trigger the vulnerability if the deserialization process is not securely configured. The test passes if an exception is caught, indicating that the system is resilient against this type of attack.
