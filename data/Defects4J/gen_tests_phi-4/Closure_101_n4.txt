public void testProcessClosurePrimitives() {
    // Assuming a method `compileFile` that takes a file and a boolean flag for processClosurePrimitives
    boolean resultFalse = compileFile("testFile.g", false);
    boolean resultTrue = compileFile("testFile.g", true);

    // Check that primitives are processed in both cases
    assertFalse(resultFalse);  // Expecting it to not process when set to false
    assertTrue(resultTrue);    // Expecting it to process when set to true
}

Note: The `compileFile` method should be a mock or a stub that simulates the compilation process and returns whether primitives were processed based on the flag. Adjust the method name and logic according to your actual implementation.
