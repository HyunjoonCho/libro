Note: The `runClosureCompiler` method is a placeholder for the actual logic that would run the Closure Compiler on the provided JavaScript code. The `ClosureCompilerException` is a placeholder for the actual exception that the Closure Compiler would throw in this scenario. Adjust these according to your actual implementation.
