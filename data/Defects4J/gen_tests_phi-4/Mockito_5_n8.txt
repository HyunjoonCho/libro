public void testMockitoTimeoutWithoutJUnit() {
    // Assuming `mock` is an instance of a mock object created with Mockito
    mock(Observable.class);

    // This line is expected to throw a VerifyError or NoClassDefFoundError
    verify(mock(Observable.class), timeout(500)).countObservers();
}

### Explanation:
- The test method `testMockitoTimeoutWithoutJUnit` is designed to reproduce the `VerifyError` or `NoClassDefFoundError` when using Mockito 1.10.x's timeout verification without JUnit on the classpath.
- The `timeout(500)` method is used to verify that `countObservers()` is called within 500 milliseconds.
- The issue arises because Mockito 1.10.x internally uses JUnit 4.x classes, which leads to a `VerifyError` or `NoClassDefFoundError` if JUnit is not present on the classpath.
