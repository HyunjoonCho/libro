public void testIncompleteReinitialization() {
    EventSystem eventSystem = new EventSystem();

    // Define two events that occur in the same step
    Event event1 = new Event("Event1");
    Event event2 = new Event("Event2");

    // Register events with the system
    eventSystem.registerEvent(event1);
    eventSystem.registerEvent(event2);

    // Simulate both events occurring in the same step
    eventSystem.simulateStep(new Event[]{event1, event2});

    // Assert that the first event is accepted
    assertTrue(event1.isAccepted());

    // Assert that the second event cannot be processed correctly
    assertFalse(event2.isAccepted());
    assertEquals("ReinitializationIncomplete", event2.getFailureReason());
}

In this test:

- `EventSystem` is a hypothetical class managing events.
- `Event` is a hypothetical class representing an event, with methods like `isAccepted()` and `getFailureReason()`.
