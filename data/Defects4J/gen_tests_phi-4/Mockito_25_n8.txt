public void testSetEnrollmentCommandWithUnEnrollmentWithNull() {
    Whitebox.invokeMethod(erxProviderManager, "setCommand", Provider.class, null, retait, mail);
}

In this test method, we attempt to reproduce the failure by invoking `Whitebox.invokeMethod` with `null` as one of the parameters, which leads to a `NullPointerException`. The test captures the behavior described in the bug report.
