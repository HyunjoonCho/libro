Note: Since Java doesn't have a `TypeError` like JavaScript, you would need to create a custom exception or use a relevant Java exception type for testing purposes. This test assumes a `SecurityException` might be thrown as a proxy for the described behavior. Adjust the exception type as needed based on your environment.
