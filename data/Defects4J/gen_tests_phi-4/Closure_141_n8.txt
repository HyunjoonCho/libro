This test method checks the expected behavior that the side effects of `function1 || function2` are taken into account, by evaluating `(Math.sin(0) || Math.cos(0))`. The expected result is `1.0` since `Math.cos(0)` evaluates to `1.0` and should be the result of the expression due to short-circuit evaluation.
