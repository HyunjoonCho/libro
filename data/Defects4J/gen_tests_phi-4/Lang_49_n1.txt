public void testFractionReduceWithZeroNumerator() {
    Fraction fraction = new Fraction(0, 5);
    assertDoesNotThrow(() -> fraction.reduce());
}

**Note:** Ensure that the `Fraction` class has a `reduce()` method that is supposed to handle the case where the numerator is zero without causing an infinite loop. The test checks that calling `reduce()` does not throw an exception when the numerator is zero.
