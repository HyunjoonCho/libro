public void testMockitoTimeoutWithoutJUnit() {
    Observable mockObservable = mock(Observable.class);
    verify(mockObservable, timeout(500)).countObservers();
}

This test method attempts to use Mockito's `verify` method with a timeout, which, according to the bug report, will fail with a `VerifyError` or `NoClassDefFoundError` if JUnit is not on the classpath and Mockito version 1.10.x is used. The test is designed to reproduce the described failure behavior.
