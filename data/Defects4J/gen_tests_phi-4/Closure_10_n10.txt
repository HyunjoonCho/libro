public void testTernaryOperatorTypeMixing() {
    // Simulating the JavaScript behavior in Java
    Object result = (Math.random() > 0.5? "1" : 2) + 3 + 4;
    
    // Expected result should be a string "134" if type mixing is handled like in JavaScript
    assertEquals("134", result.toString());
}

This test checks if the type mixing in a ternary operator results in unexpected type conversion in Java, similar to the JavaScript issue described.
