Note: `MyFunction` should be a class implementing the `UnivariateRealFunction` interface, representing the function for which the root is being found. This test assumes that `BracketingNthOrderBrentSolver` is a class in your codebase and that `solve` method signature matches the usage. Adjust as necessary for your actual implementation
