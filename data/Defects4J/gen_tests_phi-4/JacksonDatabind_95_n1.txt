### Explanation:

- **Objective**: The test aims to confirm that calling `constructFromCanonical` with an unparameterized generic type string results in a `NullPointerException` in the specified version of the library.
- **Setup**: An `ObjectMapper` is created, and its `TypeFactory` is used to attempt type construction.
- **Assertion**: The test expects a `NullPointerException`. If the exception is not thrown, the test fails using `
