public void testMockingAbstractClassFailure() {
    // Attempt to mock an abstract class
    AbstractAccountService accountService = Mockito.mock(AbstractAccountService.class);

    // Try to stub a method of the abstract class
    Mockito.when(accountService.getAccount("123")).thenReturn(new UserAccount());

    // This line should fail because Mockito cannot mock abstract classes
    accountService.getAccount("123");
}

In this test:

- We attempt to mock an abstract class `AbstractAccountService`.
- We try to stub the `getAccount` method.
- The test will fail because Mockito does not support mocking abstract classes directly, which is the core issue described in the bug report.
