public void testClassCastExceptionWithMock() {
    // Using a mock with a default answer
    MyService myServiceMock = mock(MyService.class, RETURNS_DEFAULTS);

    // Perform some operations or interactions

    // This will throw the ClassCastException
    verifyZeroInteractions(myServiceMock);
}

Note: This test assumes that `MyService` is an interface or class that is being mocked, and `RETURNS_DEFAULTS` is a valid mocking strategy available in the version of the mocking framework being used.
