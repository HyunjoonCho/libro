public void testCatchEWarning() {
    try {
        int x = 5;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        String s = "FAIL" + e.getClass().getName() + ": " + e.getMessage();
        assertTrue(s.contains("FAIL")); // Ensure's' is constructed
    }
}

This test simulates the scenario by catching an exception and using `e` in the catch block, ensuring that `e` is defined and used correctly within the block. The test verifies that the string `s` is constructed using `e`, which should prevent the `JSC_UNDEFINED_NAME` warning.
