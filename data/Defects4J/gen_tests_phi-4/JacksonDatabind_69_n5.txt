public void testConstructorSelection() throws IOException {
    ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
    String json = "{ \"intField\": 1, \"stringField\": \"foo\" }";
    
    // Attempt to deserialize the JSON into SimplePojo
    SimplePojo pojo = mapper.readValue(json, SimplePojo.class);
    
    // Assert that the deserialization fails due to incorrect constructor selection
    assertEquals(1, pojo.getIntField());
    assertEquals("foo", pojo.getStringField());
}

This test method is expected to produce the `JsonMappingException` described in the bug report, as it attempts to deserialize JSON into a class with multiple constructors, only one of which is annotated with `@JsonCreator`.
