public void testJsonIgnorePropertiesCauseOnGAE() throws Exception {
    ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
    String json = "{\"message\":\"Test exception\"}";

    // Attempt to deserialize JSON into MyException
    MyException exception = mapper.readValue(json, MyException.class);

    // Ensure that the "cause" property was ignored and not populated
    assertNull(exception.getCause());
}

This test ensures that the `@JsonIgnoreProperties("cause")` annotation is correctly applied, and the `cause` property is not populated during deserialization on Google App Engine. The test will fail if the `cause` property is not ignored, reproducing the described behavior.
