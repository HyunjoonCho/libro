}

Note: Replace `Weight`, `MultivariateVectorOptimizer`, and `createOptimizerWithWeights` with the actual class and method names used in your codebase. The `assertThrows` method is used to verify that an `OutOfMemoryError` is thrown when attempting to create the optimizer with a large number of weights.
