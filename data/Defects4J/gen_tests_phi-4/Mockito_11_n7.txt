public void testDelegatingMethodEquals() {
    // Assuming CustomVerificationMode is a class that extends VerificationMode
    CustomVerificationMode customMode = new FirstInvocationVerificationMode();
    DelegatingMethod delegate = new DelegatingMethod(customMode);

    // Simulate invocation
    Invocation firstInvocation = new Invocation(...);
    delegate.addInvocation(firstInvocation);

    // Check if equals works as expected
    assertSame("The delegate should recognize the first invocation as equal.", customMode, delegate.getVerificationMode());
}

Note: You would need to replace `...` with the actual parameters required for the `Invocation` constructor. This test assumes the existence of `FirstInvocationVerificationMode`, `CustomVerificationMode`, and `DelegatingMethod` classes, which should be part of your test setup.
