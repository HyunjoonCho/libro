public void testClosureCompilerInlining() {

    for (int i = 0; i < 25; i++) {

This test simulates the repeated calls to the function `f()` and checks if it behaves as expected without inlining. If `f()` were inlined aggressively, the function call overhead would be eliminated, but since it's not, the test should fail if the behavior deviates from the expected.
