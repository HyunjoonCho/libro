public void testRawTypeWarnings() {
    List list = mock(List.class); // Raw type warning here
    list.add("item");
    verify(list).add(anyString());
}

In this test, `List` is used as a raw type, which would trigger a raw type warning. The test uses Mockito to mock the `List` interface and verify that the `add` method is called with a string argument. This should reproduce the raw type warning described in the bug report.
