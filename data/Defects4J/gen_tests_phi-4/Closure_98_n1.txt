public void testBadVariableInliningInClosure() {

                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
                assert k == j : "k should be equal to j, but it was inlined incorrectly.";
            }

        new Thread(closure).start();
    }
}

Note: Since Java doesn't support inline functions like JavaScript and doesn't have a direct equivalent of JavaScript's `setTimeout`, the test uses a new thread to simulate asynchronous behavior. The assertion checks that `k` is equal to `j`, which would fail if `k` were incorrectly inlined.
