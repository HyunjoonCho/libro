public void testMultiValuedVariableEquality() {
    MultiValuedVariable d = new MultiValuedVariable(new String[]{"a", "b"});
    
    assertTrue(d.equals("a"));
    assertTrue(d.equals("b"));
    assertFalse(d.equals("c"));
}

This test assumes there's a `MultiValuedVariable` class with an overridden `equals` method that should correctly handle the comparison of individual elements within the multi-valued variable. The test checks that the variable `d` is considered equal to each of its components ("a" and "b") and not equal to a non-component ("c").
