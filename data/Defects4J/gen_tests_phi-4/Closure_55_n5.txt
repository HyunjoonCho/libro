This test method attempts to compile a JavaScript code snippet that contains a getter within an object literal, which is expected to trigger the described exception. The `compileCode` method is assumed to be a utility method that compiles JavaScript code and throws exceptions on compilation errors. The test checks for the specific exception message and fails if the expected exception is not thrown.
