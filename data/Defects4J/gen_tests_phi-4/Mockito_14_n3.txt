public void testIssue114() {
    // Assuming the bug was related to a method that processes a specific input
    // Let's assume the method is `processInput` and it had an issue with input "testInput"

    // Set up the expected failure scenario
    String input = "testInput";
    String expectedOutput = "Expected Output"; // Replace with the actual expected output before the fix

    // Call the method that was causing the issue
    String result = YourClass.processInput(input);

    // Assert that the result matches the expected output before the fix
    assertEquals(expectedOutput, result);
}

Replace `YourClass.processInput` and `testInput` with the actual class and method names, and adjust `expectedOutput` to reflect what the method was incorrectly producing before the fix.
