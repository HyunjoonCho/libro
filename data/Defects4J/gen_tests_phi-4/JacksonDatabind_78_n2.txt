**Notes:**
- Replace `com.yourpackage.YourClass` with the fully qualified name of a class that you want to test for unsafe deserialization.
- This test assumes that `YourClass` is a class that can be deserialized and is part of your application or a test setup.
- The test checks if deserialization occurs without exception, which is the behavior exploited by the vulnerability. In a
