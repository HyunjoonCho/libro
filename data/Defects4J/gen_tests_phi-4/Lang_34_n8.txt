public void testThreadLocalMemoryLeak() {
    // Simulate loading the class to trigger the ThreadLocal allocation
    ToStringStyle.toString();

    // Simulate a web application reload by clearing thread locals
    ThreadLocalRegistry.clearAll();

    // Verify that the memory leak is triggered by checking if the ThreadLocal is still present
    assertTrue(ToStringStyle.getThreadLocalStringBuffer() == null);
}

Note: This test assumes the existence of a `ThreadLocalRegistry` utility class that can clear all thread locals, which is often used in testing environments to simulate application reloads. The `toString()` method is called to ensure the `ThreadLocal` is initialized. The assertion checks if the `ThreadLocal` is cleared, indicating it was properly managed.
