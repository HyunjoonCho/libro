public void testRequireCallsProcessingBug() {
    // Setup the environment to simulate the bug
    ProcessClosurePrimitives pass = new ProcessClosurePrimitives();
    pass.setRequiresLevel(new RequiresLevel(true)); // Simulating requiresLevel.isOn()

    // Assuming 'ast' is the AST node representing the require call
    Node ast = createMockRequireSymbol("invalidSymbol"); // Create a mock node with an invalid require symbol

    // Call the method that is supposed to process the require call
    pass.processRequireCall(ast);

    // Check if the invalid require call was incorrectly removed
    assertTrue(ast.isPresent()); // The node should still be present, but it is removed due to the bug

    // Alternatively, if the method modifies a collection of invalid requires, check that collection
    assertFalse(pass.getInvalidRequires().isEmpty());
}

Note: This test assumes the existence of helper methods like `createMockRequireSymbol` and `getInvalidRequires` to simulate the environment and verify the behavior. Adjust the test according to the actual method signatures and available utilities in your project.
