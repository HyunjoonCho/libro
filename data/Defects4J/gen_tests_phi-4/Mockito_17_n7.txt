public void testMockitoTimeoutWithoutJUnit() {
    Observable mockObservable = mock(Observable.class);
    verify(mockObservable, timeout(500)).countObservers();
}

This test method attempts to use Mockito's `timeout` verification without JUnit on the classpath, which should trigger the `VerifyError` or `NoClassDefFoundError` as described in the bug report. Make sure to run this test with TestNG and without JUnit in the classpath to reproduce the issue.
