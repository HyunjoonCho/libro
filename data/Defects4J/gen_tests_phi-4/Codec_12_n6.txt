public void testBase64InputStreamSkip() throws Throwable {
    InputStream ins = new ByteArrayInputStream("AAAA////".getBytes("ISO-8859-1"));
    Base64InputStream instance = new Base64InputStream(ins);
    
    assertEquals(3L, instance.skip(3L)); // should skip 3 decoded characters, or 4 encoded characters
    assertEquals(255, instance.read()); // Currently returns 3, as it is decoding "A/", not "//"
}

This test method reproduces the described behavior by checking the result of `skip()` on a `Base64InputStream` and the subsequent `read()` operation. The expected behavior is that `skip(3L)` should skip 3 decoded bytes, but the test checks if it incorrectly skips in the encoded stream instead. The assertion on `read()` checks if it returns the byte `255` as expected after the skip.
