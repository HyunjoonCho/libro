public void testBadTypeInference() {
    assertThrows(IllegalStateException.class, () -> {
        test.isMatched(42); // Pass a number to trigger the length access
    });
}

This test assumes that the `test.isMatched` method is available and that it will throw an `IllegalStateException` (or a similar exception) when trying to access `length` on a `Number`, as the original JavaScript code would raise a runtime error. Adjust the exception type based on the actual behavior of your Java implementation.
