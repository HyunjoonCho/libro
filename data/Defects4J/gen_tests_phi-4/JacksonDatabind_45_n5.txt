public void testShapeNumberPrecedence() {
    // Setup with Locale that would normally enable textual representation
    Locale locale = Locale.US;
    ValueHolder valueHolder = new ValueHolder("1234", "NUMBER", locale);

    // Before fix: Textual representation should not be enabled when shape is NUMBER
    assertFalse(valueHolder.isTextualRepresentationEnabled());

    // After fix: Ensure textual representation remains disabled
    // This test should pass after the fix is applied
    assertTrue(valueHolder.isTextualRepresentationEnabled() == false);
}

In this test, we assume the existence of a `ValueHolder` class with methods `isTextualRepresentationEnabled()` and a constructor that takes a value, a shape, and a locale. Before the fix, the test should fail if textual representation is enabled when the shape is `NUMBER`. After the fix, it should pass, ensuring that the shape takes precedence.
