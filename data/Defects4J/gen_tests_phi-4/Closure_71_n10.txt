public void testPrivateFieldRedeclarationInSubclass() {
    Foo foo = new Foo();
    SubFoo subFoo = new SubFoo();
    
    // Attempt to access private fields, simulating the expected behavior
    // Normally, this would not be possible due to Java's access control,
    // but the test is meant to illustrate the logic where the issue would occur.
    
    // The actual test would involve a static analysis tool or a custom checker
    // to verify that a warning or error is not raised.
    // Here, we assume a hypothetical utility method `checkWarnings` exists:
    
    // checkWarnings("No visibility error for private field redeclaration.");
}

Note: This test is conceptual because Java's access control prevents direct access to private fields from subclasses. In practice, you'd need a static analysis tool to detect the issue described. The test assumes such a tool is in place and checks for the absence of warnings.
