public void testRawTypeWarning() {
    List rawList = new ArrayList();
    rawList.add("test");
    Iterator iterator = rawList.iterator();
    
    // This cast would cause a raw type warning
    String str = (String) iterator.next();
    assertEquals("test", str);
}

This test method uses raw types for `List` and `Iterator`, which would typically trigger raw type warnings in a Java codebase that enforces generics. The method can be added to a test class to reproduce the warning and help identify where generics need to be used instead of raw types.
