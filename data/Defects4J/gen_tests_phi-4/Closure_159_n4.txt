This test method sets up a `Runnable` to mimic the function `preload_check_all` and verifies that it can be called without exceptions, simulating the expected behavior after correct translation by the Closure Compiler. Adjust the logic inside the `Runnable` as necessary to reflect the actual implementation details.
