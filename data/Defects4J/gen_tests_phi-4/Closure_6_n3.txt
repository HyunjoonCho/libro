Note: This test method is conceptual and assumes the presence of classes `F` and `G` as described in the bug report, along with a mechanism to simulate or check the type mismatch issue. Java does not directly support prototype-based inheritance as JavaScript does, so this test is illustrative and assumes similar functionality is implemented in the Java environment.
