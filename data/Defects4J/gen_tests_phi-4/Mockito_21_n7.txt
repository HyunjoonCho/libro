public void testAccountServiceCallback() {
    // Arrange
    AccountService service = Mockito.mock(AccountService.class);
    UserAccount mockUserAccount = Mockito.mock(UserAccount.class);
    AsyncCallback<UserAccount> callback = mock(AsyncCallback.class);

    // Act
    service.getAccount("id", callback);

    // Assert
    Mockito.verify(callback).onSuccess(mockUserAccount);
    // The issue here is that using Answer with AsyncCallback is cumbersome and not type-safe
    // The test should demonstrate the difficulty in setting up such a callback with Mockito
}

This test method illustrates the difficulty in using Mockito to stub an `AsyncCallback` with an `Answer` due to lack of type safety and verbosity. The proposed solution in the bug report aims to simplify this by allowing abstract classes to be spied on, providing a cleaner and more type-safe way to handle such scenarios.
