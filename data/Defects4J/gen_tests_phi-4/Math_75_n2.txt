public void testFrequencyGetPctBug() {
    Frequency frequency = new Frequency();
    frequency.addValue(1);
    frequency.addValue(1);
    frequency.addValue(2);
    frequency.addValue(2);
    frequency.addValue(2);

    // Assuming getPct is supposed to return the percentage of values equal to the given value
    assertEquals(40.0, frequency.getPct(1), 0.001);
    assertEquals(60.0, frequency.getPct(2), 0.001);
}

This test assumes that the `Frequency` class has methods `addValue` and `getPct` (as per the bug report description). It checks if `getPct` returns the expected percentage of values equal to the given value, which should be different from what `getCumPct` would return.
