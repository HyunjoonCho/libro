public void testFinallyBlockBreakOptimization() {
    try {
        throw new RuntimeException("throw me");
    } finally {
        breakLabel:
        {
            // Simulate the behavior of the break in finally block
            break breakLabel;
        }
    }
    fail("Expected exception to be suppressed and 'ok then...' to be logged");
}

Explanation:
- The test method attempts to simulate the described behavior where a `break` in a `finally` block should prevent an exception from being thrown.
- The `fail` statement is used to ensure that the test fails if the exception is not suppressed, which would mean the `break` did not prevent the exception from propagating.
