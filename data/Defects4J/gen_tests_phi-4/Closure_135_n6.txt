public void testInheritanceNotDetected() {
    // Simulate the JavaScript environment setup
    SuperClass superClass = new SuperClass();
    SubClass subClassInstance = new SubClass();

    // Verify that the CustomMethod is present on SubClass prototype
    boolean methodPresent = subClassInstance.getClass().getDeclaredMethods().length > 0;
    boolean overrideDetected = false;

    try {
        // Attempt to invoke the CustomMethod, expecting it to be present
        subClassInstance.CustomMethod();
    } catch (NoSuchMethodException e) {
        overrideDetected = false;
    }

    // Assert that the method is present and override is detected
    assertTrue("CustomMethod should be present on SubClass", methodPresent);
    assertTrue("JSC_UNKNOWN_OVERRIDE should not be triggered", overrideDetected);
}

This test method assumes that the Java environment can simulate or mock the JavaScript behavior described. The `assertTrue` statements are used to check if the `CustomMethod` is present and if the override detection works without triggering the `JSC_UNKNOWN_OVERRIDE` warning. Adjustments might be needed based on the actual testing framework and environment capabilities.
