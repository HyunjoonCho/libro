public void testPossibleNpeOnMockCreation() {
    try {
        // Attempt to mock a class that cannot be mocked
        PowerMockito.mock(NonMockable.class);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Expected NPE due to inability to mock NonMockable
    }
}

In this test method, replace `NonMockable.class` with the actual class that caused the `NullPointerException` when attempted to be mocked with PowerMockito. The test captures the exception to demonstrate the scenario where PowerMockito cannot create a proxy for the class, leading to a `NullPointerException`.
