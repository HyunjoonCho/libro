public void testIssueWithIOUtilsSkip() {
    ByteArrayInputStream bais = new ByteArrayInputStream(new byte[100]);
    CipherInputStream cis = new CipherInputStream(bais, /* Assume a valid cipher instance */);
    TarInputStream tis = new TarInputStream(cis);

    // Attempt to skip bytes
    long skipped = tis.skip(50L);
    assertEquals(0, skipped);

    // Verify that skip did not advance the stream as expected
    byte[] buffer = new byte[1];
    int bytesRead = tis.read(buffer);
    // Assuming the read should return -1 if skip failed due to end of buffer
    assertEquals(-1, bytesRead);
}

Note: The test assumes a valid cipher instance is provided for `CipherInputStream`. The test checks that `skip` returns `0` and that subsequent `read` returns `-1`, indicating the stream did not advance as expected. Adjust the setup and assertions based on the actual behavior and environment.
