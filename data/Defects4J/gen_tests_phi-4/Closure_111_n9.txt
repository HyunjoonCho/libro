public void testGoogIsArray() {
    // Assuming there's a mock or stub for goog.isArray
    Object object = new Object(); // This is not an array

    // Mock the behavior of goog.isArray to return true for this test
    // This is a conceptual representation as Java doesn't have goog.isArray
    boolean isArray = true; // Simulate goog.isArray(object) returning true

    if (isArray) {
        Array x; // The compiler expects x to be an Array
        x = (Array) object; // Casting Object to Array, which should fail at runtime
        assertEquals("Array expected, but got Object", Array.class, x.getClass());
    }
}

Note: This is a conceptual test since `goog.isArray` is a JavaScript function, and Java does not have a direct equivalent. The test assumes a mock or stub for `goog.isArray`. In a real scenario, you would need to replicate the environment where `goog.isArray` is used.
