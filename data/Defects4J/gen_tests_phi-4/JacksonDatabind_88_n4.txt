public void testMissingTypeChecks() {
    // Assuming JavaType is a class that supports limited generic typing
    JavaType expectedType = new JavaType(Integer.class);
    JavaType actualType = new JavaType(String.class);

    // Attempt to assign or process with incompatible types
    Object incompatibleObject = new Integer(42); // This should be incompatible with String JavaType

    boolean result = expectedType.isCompatible(actualType); // Hypothetical method to check compatibility
    assertFalse(result);

    try {
        actualType.assign(incompatibleObject); // Hypothetical method that should fail
        fail("Expected an exception due to incompatible type assignment");
    } catch (IncompatibleTypeException e) {
        // Expected exception
    }
}

This test method assumes the existence of methods like `isCompatible` and `assign` in the `JavaType` class, which are responsible for checking type compatibility and assigning values, respectively. The test checks that an exception is thrown when trying to assign an incompatible type, simulating the issue described in the bug report.
