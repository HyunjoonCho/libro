public void testCodepointU007fAppearsRawInOutput() {
    String input = "\\x7f";
    String expectedOutput = "\\x7f";
    String actualOutput = someClosureCompilerMethod(input); // Assuming this method processes the input similar to the compiler

    assertEquals(expectedOutput, actualOutput, "Codepoint U+007f should appear as '\\x7f' in the output");
}

**Note:** The method `someClosureCompilerMethod(input)` is a placeholder for the actual method used to process the input string. You would need to replace it with the actual method call from your codebase that simulates the behavior of the Closure Compiler in this context.
