public void testCompilerWarningForOverriddenMethods() {
    // Simulate the environment setup as described in the bug report
    // Note: This is a conceptual test, actual implementation would require a mock or simulation of the Closure Compiler's behavior

    // Create instances of Foo and Bar
    Foo foo = new Bar();
    Bar bar = new Bar();

    // Test the overridden methods
    assertEquals(3, foo.add(3, 4)); // Foo's add should be called, expected result is 3
    try {
        bar.add(3, 4); // This should throw an exception due to wrong argument count
        fail("Expected an exception due to wrong argument count in Bar.prototype.add");
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        // Expected exception
    }
}

Note: This test assumes that the environment is set up to simulate the behavior of the Closure Compiler as described. In practice, you would need a way to mock or simulate the compiler's behavior to trigger the expected warnings.
