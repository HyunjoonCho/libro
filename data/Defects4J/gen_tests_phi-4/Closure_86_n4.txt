public void testSideEffectsAnalysis() {
    Foo foo = new Foo();
    foo.setLocation("http://www.google.com/");
    
    // Assuming there's a mechanism to capture or assert the side effect
    // For example, using a mock or spy to verify the side effect
    // This is a placeholder for whatever side effect verification mechanism you use
    // assertLocationIsSetToGoogle(foo);
}

Note: Since the actual side effect (navigation) cannot be directly tested in a JUnit test, you would typically use mocking frameworks like Mockito to spy on the `window.location` or similar mechanisms in your environment to verify the effect. The placeholder comment indicates where you would implement such a verification.
