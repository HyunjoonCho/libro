public void testGenerateChangeListWithLabels() {
    // Simulate the environment setup
    Repository repository = new Repository();
    repository.checkout("master");
    repository.pullChanges("szpak:topic/releaseLabels");

    // Execute the method that generates the change list
    ChangeList changeList = repository.generateChangeListSeparatedByLabels();

    // Assert that changes are not unknown
    assertFalse(changeList.containsChange("UnknownChangeType"));
}

### Explanation:
- **Repository Simulation**: The test assumes the existence of a `Repository` class that can simulate checking out branches and pulling changes.
- **Method Execution**: The `generateChangeListSeparatedByLabels()` method is called to simulate the behavior that is failing.
- **Assertion**: The test checks that the change list does not contain any changes labeled as "UnknownChangeType", which would indicate a failure similar to the one described in the bug report. Adjust the assertion
