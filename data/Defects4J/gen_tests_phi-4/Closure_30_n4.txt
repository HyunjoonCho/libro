public void testCombiningTemporaryStrings() {
    // Assuming sgxColorRGBA is a class available in the context
    sgxColorRGBA color = new sgxColorRGBA(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0); // Example values for RGBA

    // Expected output: "7f7f7fff"
    String expected = "7f7f7fff";

**Note:** This test assumes that `sgxColorRGBA` is a class available in your context and that it has a constructor that takes RGBA values as parameters. Adjust the instantiation if necessary to fit your actual class design.
