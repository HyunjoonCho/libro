public void testInfiniteLoopInFractionReduce() {

    // Since this is an infinite loop, we can't directly assert anything here.

*Note: The actual test method doesn't have assertions because the issue is an infinite loop, which will prevent the test from completing. The test will fail if the loop does not terminate.*
