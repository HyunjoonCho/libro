public void testTokenBufferDelegateDeserialization() {
    ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
    String json = "{\"a\":1,\"b\":null}";

    Value value = mapper.readValue(json, Value.class);

    // Assuming Value has fields 'a' and 'b' and corresponding getters
    assertEquals(1, value.getA());
    assertNull(value.getB());
}

Note: Ensure that the `Value` class is properly defined with fields `a` and `b`, and that it uses `TokenBuffer` in the `from` method. The test checks that the deserialization produces the expected object state, even though the `TokenBuffer` behavior might not match the expected token sequence. Adjust the `Value` class and its fields as necessary.
