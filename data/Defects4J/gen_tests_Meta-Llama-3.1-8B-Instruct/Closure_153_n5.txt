public void testNamespaceDefinition() {
    String prototypeJs = "if (!Node) var Node = {};";
    String modifiedJs = "Node||(Node={});";
    assertEquals(prototypeJs, modifiedJs);
}

However, this is not a very good test, as it's just comparing two strings. A better approach would be to write a test in a JavaScript environment, such as Selenium, to check how the browser interprets the code. 

But if you still want to stick with Java, you could write a test that checks the behavior of a JavaScript engine, like Rhino:

public void testNamespaceDefinition() throws Exception {
    ScriptEngineManager manager = new ScriptEngineManager();
    ScriptEngine engine = manager.getEngineByName("js");
    engine.put("Node", null);
    String result = (String) engine.eval("var Node; if (!Node) var Node = {}; Node");
    assertEquals("", result);
}

This test checks if the JavaScript engine correctly defines the `Node` variable when it's not already defined.
