public void testReleaseTriggering() {
    // Arrange
    // Assuming there's a method that triggers the release
    ReleaseTrigger releaseTrigger = new ReleaseTrigger();
    
    // Act
    releaseTrigger.triggerRelease();
    
    // Assert
    // The expected behavior is that the release is triggered
    // This might involve checking the state of the system or the release process
    // For example:
    assertTrue(releaseTrigger.isReleaseTriggered());
