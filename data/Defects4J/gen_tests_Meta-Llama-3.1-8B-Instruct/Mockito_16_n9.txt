public void testIssue125() {
    when(mockedList.size()).thenReturn(0);
    List mockedList = mock(List.class);
    assertSame(0, mockedList.size());
}

This test method creates a mock list, sets its size to return 0 when the `size()` method is called, and then asserts that the size is indeed 0. If this test passes, it suggests that the issue is not related to this specific test case. If it fails, it might indicate a problem with the mocking library. 

However, to accurately reproduce the issue described in the bug report, we would need more information about what the issue was and how it was supposed to trigger a release.
