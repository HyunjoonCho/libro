public void testSimplexSolver() {
    // Set up the test inputs
    Matrix A = new Matrix(...); // create a matrix A
    Vector b = new Vector(...); // create a vector b
    Vector c = new Vector(...); // create a vector c
    Bounds bounds = new Bounds(...); // create bounds constraints

    // Run the Simplex Solver
    Solution solution = SimplexSolver.solve(A, b, c, bounds);

    // Assert the expected result
    assertEquals(expectedResult, solution);
}

Please note that this is a general template and would need to be filled in with the actual test inputs, expected result, and implementation of the SimplexSolver class. 

If the problem is specified with a set of inputs and expected result, I can help with a more detailed test method.
