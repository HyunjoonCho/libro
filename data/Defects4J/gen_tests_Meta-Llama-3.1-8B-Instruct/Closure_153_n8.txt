However, note that JUnit is a Java testing framework, so this test method would not be written in Java. 

If you're looking for a Java test method, it's not directly possible to reproduce the failure behavior of a JavaScript issue. The JavaScript issue is related to how the Prototype library defines the `Node` variable and how it interacts with the JavaScript engine, which is not something that can be directly tested in a Java environment.

However, you could write a test method that tests the behavior of a Java method that is supposed to parse or execute JavaScript code, and see if it correctly handles the `Node` variable definition:

public void testParseJavaScriptWithNodeDefinition() {
    String script = "if (!Node)
