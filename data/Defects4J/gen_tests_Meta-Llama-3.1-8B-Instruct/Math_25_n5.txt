public void testParameterGuesser() {
    HarmonicFitter fitter = new HarmonicFitter();
    double[] guess = fitter.getParameterGuesser().guess();
    // Assert that the amplitude value is not a reasonable guess
    assertTrue(guess[0] < 0 || guess[0] > 100); // Replace 100 with a more reasonable upper limit
}

This test method creates an instance of the HarmonicFitter class and calls its getParameterGuesser() method to get an instance of the ParameterGuesser class. It then calls the guess() method to get an array of guessed parameter values, including the amplitude. The test asserts that the amplitude value is not a reasonable guess, but this assertion may need to be adjusted based on the actual implementation of the HarmonicFitter class.
