public void testJacksonDeserializerVulnerability() {
    ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
    Object o = mapper.readValue("{\"@type\":\"java.lang.String\"}", Object.class);
    if (!(o instanceof String)) {
        fail("Expected String, but was " + o.getClass().getName());
    }
}

This test will fail because the deserialized object will be a `String` instance, which is not the expected behavior. However, please note that this test should not be run in a production environment, as it could potentially exploit the vulnerability.
