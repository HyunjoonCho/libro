This bug report is about a specific issue in the JFreeChart library, and it appears that it's related to the `DatasetUtilities.iterateRangeBounds()` method. Since this is a forum post, it doesn't provide enough information to create a self-contained test case. However, based on the description, I can provide a hypothetical test case that might reproduce the issue:

```java
public void testIterateRangeBounds() {
    XYSeries series = new XYSeries("Test");
    series.add(1, 2);
    series.add(3, 4);
    series.add(5, 6);

    double[] x = new double[3];
    double[] y = new double[3];

    DatasetUtilities.iterateRangeBounds(series, 0, 2, 0.5, x, y);

    // Verify the expected results
    assertEquals(1, x[0], 0.001);
    assertEquals(2, y[0], 0.001);
    assertEquals(3, x[1], 0.001);
    assertEquals(4, y[1], 0.001);
    assertEquals(5, x[2], 0.001);
    assertEquals(6, y[2
