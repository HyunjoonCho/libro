public void testMockitoReleaseTrigger() {
    // Arrange
    Mockito mock(Object.class);
    
    // Act
    // This should trigger a release, but it didn't in issue #125
    // If the issue is related to a specific scenario, add the necessary code here
    
    // Assert
    // Add assertions to verify the expected behavior
    // If the issue is related to a missing release, this test should fail
}

However, without more information about the specific issue, it's difficult to provide a more accurate test method. The original issue #125 may have been related to a specific scenario or edge case, so this test method would need to be modified to match that scenario.
