This test will fail because it should not be possible to deserialize a `TypeReference` object from a JSON string. However, in vulnerable versions of Jackson, this would allow for arbitrary code execution.

Please note that you should not attempt to exploit this vulnerability in a real-world application, and the test above is for demonstration purposes only.
