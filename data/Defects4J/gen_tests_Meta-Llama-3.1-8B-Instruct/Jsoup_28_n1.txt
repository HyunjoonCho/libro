public void testJsoupClean() throws Exception {
    String html = "<a href=\"" + URL + "\">" + URL + "</a>";
    String cleaned = Jsoup.clean(html, Whitelist.none());
    assertEquals(URL, cleaned);
}

In this test, we're passing the HTML string to `Jsoup.clean()` with a whitelist of none, which should leave the string unchanged. However, the bug is causing the query parameters to be unescaped, so we're asserting that the cleaned string is equal to the original URL.
