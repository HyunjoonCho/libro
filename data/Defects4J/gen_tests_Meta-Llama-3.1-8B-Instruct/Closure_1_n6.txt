public void testMethodArgumentsNotOptimizedAway() {
    int foo(int a, int b) {
        return a;
    }
    assertEquals(2, foo.length);
}

However, this test would not actually test the optimization issue, because Java does not perform function inlining or argument elimination like the Closure Compiler does.
