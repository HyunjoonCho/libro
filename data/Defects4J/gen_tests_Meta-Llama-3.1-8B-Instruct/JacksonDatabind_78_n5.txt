public void testDeserializeWithDefaultTyping() throws JsonProcessingException {
    ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
    String json = "{\"value\":\"@com.sun.rowset.CachedRowSet\"}";
    CachedRowSet rowSet = mapper.readValue(json, Object.class);
    assertNotNull(rowSet);
}

This test will attempt to deserialize a JSON object into an `Object` type, which can lead to the security vulnerability. Please note that this is just a demonstration and should not be used in production code.

To fix this issue, it's recommended to use a custom deserialization filter or disable default typing altogether.
