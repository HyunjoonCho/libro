public void testReleaseTrigger() {
    // Set up the conditions that should trigger the release
    // This could be specific to the Mockito framework and its release process
    // Assuming some method or field that determines whether a release should be triggered
    Mockito.releaseTrigger.setValue(true);
    
    // Perform the action that should trigger the release
    // This could be a specific test case or scenario that was supposed to trigger the release
    // in the original issue #125
    // For example:
    when(mockObject.doSomething()).thenReturn(true);
    
    // Check that the release is triggered
    // This could involve checking that a specific method or field is called or set to a certain value
    // in the Mockito framework
    verify(Mockito.releaseTrigger, times(1)).setValue(true);
}

Please note that this is a highly speculative example and the actual test method would depend on the specific details of the Mockito
