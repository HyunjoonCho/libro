}

Note that this test method is not a traditional JUnit test, as it's not asserting a specific expected result. It's more of a reproduction test, which aims to verify that the Closure Compiler produces the problematic obfuscated code. To make this test more robust, you could add a step to check that the obfuscated code triggers a TypeError in Firefox. However, this would require additional setup and infrastructure to run the obfuscated code in a browser environment.
