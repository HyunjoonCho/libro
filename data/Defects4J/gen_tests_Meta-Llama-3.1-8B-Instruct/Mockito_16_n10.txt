public void testReleaseTrigger() {
    // Setup conditions that should trigger release
    boolean condition = true;
    // Call the method that should trigger release
    myMethod(condition);
    // Assert that release was triggered
    assertTrue(releaseTriggered);
}

However, without more information about the actual issue, this test method is purely speculative. The actual test method would depend on the specific conditions and requirements of the issue.
