This is not a bug report with a specific reproducible scenario, but rather a request to review and merge a fix for an existing issue. Therefore, it's not possible to create a self-contained reproducing test case from this information.

However, if you're asking for a test case for the fix itself, I would need more information about the issue #114 and the fix proposed by @bric3. If you can provide that information, I can try to help you create a test case.
