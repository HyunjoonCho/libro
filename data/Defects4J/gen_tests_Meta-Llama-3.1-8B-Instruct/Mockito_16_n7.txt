public void testReleaseTrigger() {
    // Assuming some setup or configuration that should trigger the release
    when(someMock.someMethod()).thenReturn(someValue);
    // Now, the release should be triggered
    doSomethingThatShouldTriggerRelease();
    // Verify that the release was triggered
    verify(someOtherMock).someMethodToVerify();
}

However, without more information about the specific issue, it's difficult to write a precise test method that reproduces the failure behavior.
