public void testNamespaceInheritance() {
    String html = "<html><body><p>test</p><span xmlns:ns='http://example.com/ns'>span</span><ns:p>inherited namespace</ns:p></body></html>";
    Document doc = Jsoup.parse(html);
    Element body = doc.body();
    Element p = body.child(0);
    Element span = body.child(1);
    Element inheritedP = body.child(2);

    assertEquals("http://example.com/ns", span.namespace("ns"));
    assertEquals("http://example.com/ns", inheritedP.namespace("ns"));
}

However, to truly reproduce the bug, you would need to test that the namespace is not being properly reset for the `p` element, which should not have the namespace. The test above will fail because the `p` element does not have the namespace, but the `inheritedP` element does. To test that the namespace is being inherited incorrectly, you would need to add an additional test:
