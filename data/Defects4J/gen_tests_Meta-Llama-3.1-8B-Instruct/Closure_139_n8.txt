public void testRedefinitionOfFunction() {
    Function f = new Function() {
        public Object execute() {
            return 2;
        }
    };
    System.out.println(f.execute()); // prints 2

    f = new Function() {
        public Object execute() {
            return 1;
        }
    };

    System.out.println(f.execute()); // prints 1

    f = new Function() {
        public Object execute() {
            return 1;
        }
    };

    System.out.println(f.execute()); // prints 1
}

However, this is not a direct translation, and the original code is written in JavaScript. If we want to write a test in Java that reproduces the same issue, we would need to use a Java library that allows us to create functions and override them like in the original JavaScript code.

In Java, we can use a class with a method to simulate the function behavior. Here's a simple example:

public class Function
