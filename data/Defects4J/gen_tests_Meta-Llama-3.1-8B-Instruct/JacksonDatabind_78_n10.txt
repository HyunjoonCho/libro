public void testDeserializationVulnerability() {
    Object obj = new Object();
    try {
        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
        mapper.readValue("null", obj.getClass());
        fail("Expected DeserializationException");
    } catch (JsonParseException e) {
        // expected
    }
}

However, note that this test will not actually trigger the vulnerability, as it will fail with a `JsonParseException` because Jackson will not attempt to deserialize a null JSON value to an arbitrary class. 

To create a test that triggers the vulnerability, we would need to have access to the specific code or configuration that allows default typing in the Jackson deserialization process, which is typically not recommended.

A better approach would be to test the configuration options that allow default typing and ensure they are properly validated and handled.

public void testDefaultTypingConfigured() {
    ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
    mapper.enableDefaultTyping(DefaultTyping.NON_FINAL, As.WRAPPOJO);
    try
