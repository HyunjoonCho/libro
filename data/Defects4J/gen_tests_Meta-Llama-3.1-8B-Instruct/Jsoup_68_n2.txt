public void testStackOverflowError() {
    int numPages = 10;
    for (int i = 0; i < numPages; i++) {
        try {
            // Simulate loading a web page
            new URL("http://example.com").openConnection().getContent();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // Ignore exception
        }
    }
}

However, please note that this test method will likely fail due to the fact that it's trying to load multiple web pages, which is not a realistic test case.

To create a more meaningful test, we would need more information about the specific code that's causing the StackOverflowError in version 1.11.1. 

If the issue is related to a specific method or class, we can create a test method that calls that method with a large input to simulate the scenario.

public void testStackOverflowError() {
    String largeUrl = repeatString("http://example.com", 10000);
