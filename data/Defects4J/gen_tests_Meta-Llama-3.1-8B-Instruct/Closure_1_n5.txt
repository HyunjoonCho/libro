testFunctionArgumentsNotOptimizedAway() {
    function foo(bar, baz) {
        return bar;
    }
    assertEquals(2, foo.length);
}

This test checks that the `length` property of the `foo` function is not optimized away, which is 2 because it has two arguments. If the function's length property is optimized away, the test will fail. 

To run this test, you would need a JavaScript test framework that can run JavaScript code, such as Jest or Mocha.
