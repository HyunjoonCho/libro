The provided bug report does not mention a specific test case or a failure behavior to reproduce. It appears to be a report of a code coverage analysis using Codecov, showing that a pull request (#467) does not change the code coverage of the Mockito repository.

If you could provide more information about the actual bug or failure you want to reproduce, I would be happy to help you write a JUnit test method to reproduce it.
