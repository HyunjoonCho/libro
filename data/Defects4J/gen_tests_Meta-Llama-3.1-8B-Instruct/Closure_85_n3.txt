public void testSwitchStatementBug() throws IOException {
    // Compile the JavaScript code
    ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder("java", "-jar", "compiler.jar", "--js", "test.js");

However, please note that this is not a direct test of the bug, but rather a test that the compiler throws an exception when given the buggy code. A more direct test would be to write a test in JavaScript that exercises the bug and checks for the expected behavior. 

If you want to write a JUnit test that reproduces the bug in Java, you would need to write a test that simulates the JavaScript environment and runs the buggy code. However, this would be a complex test and would likely involve using a JavaScript engine like Rhino or Nashorn.

Here's an example of how you could write
