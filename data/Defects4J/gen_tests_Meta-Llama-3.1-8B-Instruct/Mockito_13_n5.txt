public void testFixedBehavior() {
    // assuming the fix involves changing the behavior of a method
    // and it was previously failing with this input
    // verify that the fix is correct and the method now returns the expected result
    assertEquals(expectedResult, methodUnderTest(input));
}

However, without more information about the bug and the fix, it's impossible to provide a specific test method.
