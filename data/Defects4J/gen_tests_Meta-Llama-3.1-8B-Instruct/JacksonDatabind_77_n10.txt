public void testDeserializeSecurityVulnerability() throws JsonProcessingException {
    ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
    String json = "{\"@type\":\"java.lang.RuntimeException\"}";
    try {
        mapper.readValue(json, Object.class);
        fail("Expected JsonProcessingException to be thrown");
    } catch (JsonProcessingException e) {
        // Expected exception
    }
}

This test will attempt to deserialize a JSON object with a field named `@type` set to `java.lang.RuntimeException`, which is the field that triggers the vulnerability. The `ObjectMapper` should throw a `JsonProcessingException` when trying to deserialize this object, but the actual behavior may vary depending on the Jackson version and configuration. 

Again, please note that running this test may cause harm to your system if the vulnerability is not patched.
