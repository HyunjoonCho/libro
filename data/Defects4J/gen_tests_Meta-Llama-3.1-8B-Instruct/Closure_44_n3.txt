public void testAlertFunction() {
    String input = "/ / / / /";
    String expected = "/ /// /";
    String actual = processInput(input);
    assertEquals(expected, actual);
}

private String processInput(String input) {
    // This is a placeholder for the actual JavaScript function that's causing the issue
    return input.replace("  ", " /");
}

Please note that this is not a real test, as it's not possible to run JavaScript code in a JUnit test. The `processInput` method is a placeholder for the actual function that's causing the issue. 

In a real-world scenario, you would need to use a JavaScript testing framework like Jest or Mocha to test this function.
