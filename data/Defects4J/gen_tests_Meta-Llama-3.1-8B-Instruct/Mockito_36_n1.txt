public void testMockitoJUnitRule() {
    @Rule
    public TestRule rule = new MockitoJUnitRule(this);
    
    // Test code here...
}

However, to demonstrate the issue with JUnit 4.7, you would need to use a version of JUnit that is older than 4.9. Unfortunately, it's not possible to use an older version of JUnit directly in a test method.

But here's an example of how you might test the Mockito JUnit rule with JUnit 4.7:

public class Test extends TestCase {
    public void setUp() throws Exception {
        MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(this);
    }
    
    public void testMockitoAnnotations() {
        // Test code here...
    }
}

This test class uses the `setUp` method to initialize the Mockito annotations, which is the way you would do it with JUnit 4.7.
