public void testCVE20177525() throws Exception {
    ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();

}

This test attempts to deserialize a JSON object with a `@type` field that specifies the type of the object to be deserialized. In this case, it tries to deserialize a string into an object of type `java.lang.String`. If the deserialization process is vulnerable to the CVE-2017-7525, it should succeed and the result should be a `String` object. However, this is not the expected behavior, and the test should fail.

Note that this is just an example and might not actually trigger the vulnerability in a real-world scenario. The actual exploit of the CVE-2017-7525 would likely involve more complex serialization and deserialization logic, possibly involving custom types and serialization mechanisms.

Also, it's worth noting that this
