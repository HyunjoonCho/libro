public void testIndexOfWarning() {
    String s = "hello";
    String result = s.toLowerCase().indexOf("l");
    // No warning is expected in this case, but it's not the same as the JavaScript code
}

However, if we were to write a test to check that the warning is not produced, we would need a Java compiler that supports warnings, which is not a standard feature of JUnit. 

A more accurate test for this issue would be to write a JavaScript test, but since that's not possible here, we can test the expected behavior of the `indexOf` method instead:

public void testIndexOf() {
    String s = "hello";
    assertEquals(2, s.toLowerCase().indexOf("l"));
}
