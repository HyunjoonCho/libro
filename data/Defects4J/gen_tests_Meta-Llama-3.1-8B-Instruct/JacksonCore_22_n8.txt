public void testMatchCountNotUsed() {
    FilteringParserDelegate delegate = new FilteringParserDelegate();
    boolean match = delegate.match("some string");
    assertEquals(0, delegate.getMatchCount()); // This should not be 0
}

However, this is a bit artificial since we don't have the actual implementation of `FilteringParserDelegate` and `match()` method. 

A more realistic test would be to test the expected behavior of `getMatchCount()` method as per the documentation, assuming it's supposed to return the count of matches. 

public void testMatchCountNotUsed() {
    FilteringParserDelegate delegate = new FilteringParserDelegate();
    boolean match1 = delegate.match("some string");
    boolean match2 = delegate.match("another string");
    assertEquals(2, delegate.getMatchCount
