public void testNumberUtilsHexLong() {
    try {
        NumberUtils.createLong("0x1234567890abcdef");

    }
}

This test attempts to create a Long from a hex string that is too large to be represented by an Integer, but not large enough to be handled by the current implementation of NumberUtils.createLong(). If the implementation is fixed to use Long.decode() instead of valueOf(), this test should pass.
