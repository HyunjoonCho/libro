public void testTypoInHtml5Js() {
    String expectedGlobalCompositeOperation = "globalCompositeOperation";
    String expectedMiterLimit = "miterLimit";
    
    // Assuming we have a method to read the file and return the content
    String content = readHtml5JsFile();
    
    assertTrue(content.contains(expectedGlobalCompositeOperation));
    assertTrue(content.contains(expectedMiterLimit));
}
Note: This is a simple test method, you may need to adjust it based on your actual testing environment. For example, if you're using a web driver to load the HTML5 JS file, you would need to write code to load the file and then search for the expected strings.
