public void testMockito() {
    Mock mock = mock(Mock.class); // rawtype warning
    //...
}

To fix this, the test should be modified to use a parameterized type, like this:

public void testMockito() {
    Mock<String> mock = mock(Mock.class);
    //...
}

However, without more information about the specific issue, it's difficult to provide a more accurate test.
