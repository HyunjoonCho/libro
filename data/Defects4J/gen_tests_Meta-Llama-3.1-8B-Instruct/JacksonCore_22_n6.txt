public void testMatchCountNotUsed() {
    FilteringParserDelegate delegate = new FilteringParserDelegate();
    delegate.parse("123");
    assertEquals(0, delegate.getMatchCount());
}

However, if we want to test that the match count is updated when it should be, we would need to know what the expected behavior is and how to trigger it. The original issue is about making use of the _matchCount attribute, so we would need to know what it's supposed to count. 

In a real-world scenario, you would need to consult the documentation or the code implementation to understand what the expected behavior is. 

Here's an example assuming we're testing that the match count is updated when a match is found:

public void testMatchCountUpdated() {
    FilteringParserDelegate delegate = new FilteringParserDelegate();
    delegate.parse("123");
    assertEquals(1, delegate.getMatchCount());
}

Keep in mind
