public void testMockitoJUnitRuleRequiresTestInstance() {
    @Rule
    public MockitoRule rule = MockitoJUnit.rule();
    // This will fail because rule requires a test instance
    rule.apply(new Object());
}

However, if you want to test that the rule is compatible with JUnit 4.7, you can use the following test method:

public void testMockitoJUnitRuleCompatibility() {
    try {
        // Try to use MockitoJUnit.rule() with JUnit 4.7
        @Rule
        public MockitoRule rule = MockitoJUnit.rule();
        // This should fail because MockitoJUnit.rule() requires JUnit 4.9+
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Expected exception
    }
}

But the correct way to write this test would be to check that the rule is not created with JUnit 4.7, which would look like this:

public void testMockitoJUnitRuleCompatibility() {
    try {
        // Try to use MockitoJUnit.rule() with J
