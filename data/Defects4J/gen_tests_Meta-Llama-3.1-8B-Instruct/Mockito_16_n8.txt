public void testReleaseTriggering() {
    // Assuming there's a method called "triggerRelease" in the Mockito class
    Mockito mock = new Mockito();
    // Call the method that should trigger a release
    mock.triggerRelease();
    // Assert that the release is triggered
    assertTrue(mock.isReleaseTriggered());
}

Please note that this is a hypothetical example and might not accurately reflect the actual issue. The actual test method would depend on the specific class and method involved in the issue.
