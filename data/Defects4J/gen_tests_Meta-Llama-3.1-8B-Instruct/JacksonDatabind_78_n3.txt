This test attempts to deserialize a JSON object with a maliciously crafted `@type` field, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. However, please note that this test should not be run in a production environment, as it can potentially cause harm.

Also, note that Jackson has fixed this vulnerability in version 2.9.5 and later. If you're using a version of Jackson that is vulnerable, you should upgrade to
