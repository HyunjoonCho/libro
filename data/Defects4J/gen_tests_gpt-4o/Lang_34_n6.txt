    // For memory leak testing, we can't actually verify internal state without reflection,
    // but we'd simulate or inspect the environment using tooling or verbose GC logs.
    // We can add code to check if the ThreadLocal has been removed.
    // Typically these memory leaks are verified through memory profiling tools.
    
    // The test case here acts as a reminder of the issue. A complete resolution
    // requires changes in library code to manage the lifecycle of ThreadLocal properly.
