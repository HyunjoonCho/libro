I'm sorry, but it looks like you haven't provided the details necessary to create a reproducing test case. The bug report seems to be discussing a specific issue (#114) but without information about the specific problem or code snippets demonstrating the failure, I'm unable to produce a relevant test case.

Could you provide more context or details about the issue that needs a test case? For example, details about what the bug impacts or an example of code that demonstrates the issue would be helpful.
