It appears that there is no detailed description or code example for a bug in the provided text, but rather a reference to coverage status and a commit link. This makes it challenging to generate a specific test case because a clear description of the bug behavior and expected versus actual results are necessary.

However, if you provide more context or details about the issue (e.g., what the specific failure is, what the expected behavior should be, etc.), I can certainly help create a relevant test case. If you intended to discuss test cases related to coverage or change logs, please clarify further.
