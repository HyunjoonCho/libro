I'm sorry, but the description provided does not contain enough information about a specific failure or bug report related to code behavior or functionality that can be reproduced with an automated test. If you can provide more details about the nature of the bug, or the specific input and incorrect output that you are observing, I will be able to help you construct a JUnit test method.
