To generate a self-contained reproducing test case, we need a detailed description of the issue, the expected behavior, and typically some snippets of code that demonstrate the problem encountered. Since the bug report you provided lacks specific details and doesn't include any code or context about how the "Google Common Loader Extern" issue presents itself or fails, it's challenging to create an appropriate test case.

Could you provide more detailed information or a code snippet demonstrating the issue? This would help in creating an effective test case.
