I'm sorry, but the description provided does not contain any actionable information regarding a specific bug or failure in the software that can be reproduced with a JUnit test method. The description seems to refer to a commit message with a link attached and does not include details about the expected vs actual behavior, error messages, or specific functionality that is failing.
