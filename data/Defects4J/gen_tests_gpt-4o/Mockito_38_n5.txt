The bug report you provided doesn't include specific technical details, code snippets, or descriptions of unexpected behavior or errors related to a testable function or feature. Instead, it describes an issue related to generating change lists and seems to reference a code repository commit or status badge, but lacks the concrete context needed to write a reproducible test case.

To create a meaningful test, I need information on:
- The specific function or method affected by the issue.
- The expected vs. actual outcomes that demonstrate the bug.
- Relevant code snippets or simplified steps to reproduce the issue.
- Additional context about the environment (e.g., frameworks or dependencies used).

Once you provide that information, I could generate a test case to reproduce the issue as described.
