    // Define the JavaScript code as a string
    String jsCode = "// ==ClosureCompiler==\n" +
                    "// @output_file_name default.js\n" +

                    "// ==/ClosureCompiler==\n\n" +
                    "var t = null;\n\n" +
                    "window.test = function() {\n" +

                    "  t = 1;\n" +

    // Your test infrastructure would need to actually call a closure compiler API
    // or command, supplying the JS code above, and verifying that it generates the
    // "JSC_DETERMINISTIC_TEST" warning.
