I'm sorry, but the provided bug report does not contain sufficient specific information or context about a failure in the code. The report seems to relate more to code coverage and raw type warnings without details about a specific defect or behaviour to be tested. 

To create a JUnit test method for a specific bug or issue, I need details about a scenario where the software fails or behaves unexpectedly, including the expected versus actual outputs or behaviour.

If you can provide more detailed information about the specific code changes or the context in which the problem occurs, I would be happy to help write a test method for that.
