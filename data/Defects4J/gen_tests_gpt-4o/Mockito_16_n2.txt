To investigate why a specific pull request did not trigger a release in a project like Mockito, we need to consider various components such as the build configuration, continuous integration (CI) setup, and release-triggering criteria. As this issue seems related to CI/CD and release process rather than specific code in the codebase, creating a JUnit test case isn't directly applicable.

However, I can guide you on how to make diagnostic checks to find issues like this:

1. **Check the CI/CD Logs**: Look at the logs of the CI server (e.g., Jenkins, Travis CI, GitHub Actions) for the build associated with the pull request. This may provide insight into whether the build completed successfully or why the release step was skipped.

2. **Inspect Build Scripts**: Verify whether the build and deployment scripts are correctly configured to trigger a release on merged pull requests. 
   - Check for any conditional logic that might have prevented the release from being triggered.
   - Ensure that the scripts are not missing any necessary permissions or tokens to execute the release process.

3. **Review Repository Settings**: 
   - Ensure that the repository settings are correctly set to trigger releases when intended.
   - Look for branch protection rules or settings that might interfere with auto-deployments.

Since this issue pertains to a procedural setup rather than a code defect, these steps would help trace the problem and initiate an appropriate fix.
