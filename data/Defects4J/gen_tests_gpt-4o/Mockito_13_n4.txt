I understand you need a test case for a bug, but the provided description lacks specific details about the bug and its context (e.g., the system, the behavior, and what needs to be tested). However, I can guide you on how to proceed:

1. **Determine the Context**: Understand which project or component this bug is addressing. Look for more information in the corresponding repository, issues tracker, or discussions.

2. **Check Commit Changes**: If this refers to a fix in a repository, identify the commit fixing this issue. Review the files changed and possible added test cases if any.

3. **Understand Expected Behavior**: You need information on what the code was supposed to do versus what it was doing incorrectly.

4. **Write Test Case**: Based on the above insights, create a test case that replicates the incorrect behavior before the fix.

If you can access details about what #114 pertained to or more descriptions, I can help further craft a specific test case to suit that context.
