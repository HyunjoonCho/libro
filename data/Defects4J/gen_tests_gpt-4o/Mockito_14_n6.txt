Based on the limited information provided in the bug report, it seems like there isn't enough context to construct a specific test case related to "#114". The bug report does not provide details about the functionality, expected behavior, or specific input and output requirements to reproduce the issue.

To create an effective test case, we need additional information such as:

1. The component or method affected by the bug.
2. The expected behavior versus the actual behavior.
3. Any specific inputs that were used to reproduce the bug.

If you can share more details about the issue or a specific code snippet, I can help construct a relevant test case. Otherwise, if there is any generic or placeholder aspect of the system you are aware of related to issue #114, please provide that information.
