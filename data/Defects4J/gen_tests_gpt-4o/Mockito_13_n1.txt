To generate a self-contained reproducing test case for a bug, I would need more detailed information about the bug description or the code that caused the issue. The current information is not sufficient as it doesn't detail the bug's behavior or the relevant code snippet that is affected.

However, if you have access to any code changes or a more detailed description of what the bug #114 entails, please provide them. This will enable me to craft a relevant test case to reproduce and verify the issue.

If you cannot provide more information, and this is related to existing known functionality, you might need to check the repository or contact the responsible maintainer for further clarification.
