The bug report you have presented seems to be about fixing some raw type warnings in the test suite of the Mockito library. Unfortunately, this bug report doesn't provide specific steps to reproduce a behavior-related issue in code, as it is more focused on code quality improvements related to raw type warnings. In such cases, creating a self-contained test case that specifically reproduces a failure or bug isn't applicable, since the changes likely concern the internal code structure rather than correcting a functional defect.

However, if the intention is to ensure that raw types do not generate warnings, you could perform a code inspection or refactor the test suite code where raw types are used, changing them to parameterized types. Then verify through compilation that no warnings are produced.

If you have a specific snippet in the test code that you suspect could be causing issues or warnings, you can share that for more directed assistance.
