To create a self-contained reproducing test case for the issue described, I'll need more specific details about the bug or behavior related to "Google Common Loader Extern." The current description is insufficient to generate any test case because it doesn't specify what functionality is broken, what's expected, and what's happening instead.

If you can provide more details or a specific problem that needs to be tested, I would be glad to help further. Here are some possible questions that could help clarify the bug for creating a test case:

1. What behavior is expected from "Google Common Loader Extern"?
2. What behavior are you observing instead?
3. Are there specific inputs, methods, or actions that reproduce the bug?
4. Is there an error message or incorrect output?

With answers to these questions, a more accurate and meaningful test case can be constructed.
