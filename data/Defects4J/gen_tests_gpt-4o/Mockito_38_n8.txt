I'm sorry, but the provided bug report doesn't contain enough information to generate a specific JUnit test method. It appears to be more about a process or coverage report rather than a specific code functionality that can be tested with JUnit. If you have more details on the specific code behavior or function that should be tested, please provide that to generate an appropriate test method.
