It seems like the bug report you provided is not clearly describing a specific issue or bug with details required to reproduce it. The provided text appears to be a placeholder description pulled from a service like Coveralls, rather than an actual description of a bug and steps to reproduce it.

If you want assistance in generating a test case, please provide a clear and detailed bug description including:
1. Exact steps to reproduce the bug.
2. The expected behavior.
3. The actual behavior.
4. Any relevant code snippets or configuration needed to set up the scenario.

Once provided, I'll be able to help you create a self-contained test case.
