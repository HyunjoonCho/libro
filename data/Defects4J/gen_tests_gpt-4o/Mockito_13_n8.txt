To help you correctly reproduce the test case for bug report #114, I would need more information about the specific bug or the affected functionalities. The current bug report description is too brief and doesn't provide specific details or sample code that could be used to create a test case.

If you have more information or context regarding what the bug impacted, such as affected classes, methods, or expected versus actual behavior, that would be beneficial. Without more details, it's challenging to generate a meaningful test case. If you provide those details, I'll be able to better assist you in creating a self-contained JUnit test.
