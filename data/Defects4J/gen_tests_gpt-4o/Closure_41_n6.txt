public void testAdvancedModeCompilerWarnings() {
    // Setup a testing environment with a mock compiler or static analysis tool if possible.
    // As a placeholder, the comments describe the steps to reproduce the issue.

    // Step 1: Initialize base class Foo
    Foo fooInstance = new Foo();

    // Step 2: Initialize subclass Bar, which incorrectly overrides Foo's methods
    Bar barInstance = new Bar();

    // Step 3: Expect the compiler to produce warnings for incorrect @inheritDoc annotations
    // Compile the code with ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS and check for missing warnings

    // Since we cannot execute the Closure Compiler's ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS mode directly in a unit test,
    // this method instead should be used as a guide for triggering this behavior during a compilation process.
    
    // The key to the bug is that Bar's methods claim @inheritDoc, 
    // but have different signatures than those in Foo.
    
    // Expected: Compiler warnings for Bar.prototype.add and Bar.prototype.sub having different signatures.
