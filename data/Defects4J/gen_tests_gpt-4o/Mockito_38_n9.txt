To generate a self-contained reproducing test case for the bug report, we need more information about the specific issue being faced. The bug report provided seems to refer to an issue with generating a change list using labels in some kind of version control or CI/CD pipeline system, possibly related to `mockito` or a similar library, based on the context given.

However, without additional context or a code snippet that demonstrates the incorrect behavior (like what input led to what unexpected output in actual code), it's challenging to generate an exact reproducing test case. The description seems to refer to version control integration rather than a typical software bug that we would address with a unit test.

If this issue involves some misbehavior in code-based logic (for example, parsing changes), you would need to provide a snippet or clarify the logic you are having trouble with so a unit test can be created-to demonstrate the issue.

If more information about specific implementation details, code snippets, or behavior expectations is available, please share so that a precise reproducing test case can be constructed.
