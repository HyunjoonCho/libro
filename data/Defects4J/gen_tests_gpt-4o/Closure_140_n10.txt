Based on the information provided, the bug report lacks specific details about the bug or issue. Typically, a bug report that mentions the need for "Google Common Loader Extern" could relate to a problem or request for incorporating Google Closure Compiler externs into a project. However, there's insufficient detail about what behavior is incorrect or how to reproduce any specific issue.

To assist you better, additional information is required, such as:

- A code snippet showing how the problem manifests.
- The expected versus actual behavior if it's a bug.
- Any error messages or stack traces.
- A description of the environment where the issue occurs.

If you can provide more context or details, I'd be happy to help craft a test case or offer guidance on resolving the issue.
