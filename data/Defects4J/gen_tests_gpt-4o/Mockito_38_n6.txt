It seems like your request is focused on test scenarios related to change list generation, possibly in a version control tool or CI/CD pipeline. Could you please clarify the context around the bug report? Test case generation often requires understanding the underlying code or purpose the bug affects. If you have more specific code examples or behavior descriptions, please include them so I can assist you better.
