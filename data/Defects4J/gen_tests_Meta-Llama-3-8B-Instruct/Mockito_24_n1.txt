There is no specific bug report provided, but based on the description, it seems like the issue is about fixing rawtype warnings in tests. 

To generate a self-contained reproducing test case, I would need more information about the specific tests and the code that is causing the warnings. Without that, it's difficult to create a test case that reproduces the issue.

However, if you're looking to test the coverage of your code, you can use a testing framework like JUnit and JaCoCo to create test cases that cover all the lines of your code. The test cases would depend on the specific code and the lines that are not covered by the current tests.
