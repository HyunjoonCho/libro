This bug report is not about a programming language or a library, but about a specific annotation processor for JavaScript. It seems that the Closure Compiler does not support the @lends annotation, which is used by JSDoc to indicate that certain methods are part of a class's prototype.

As this is not a programming language or a library, it's not possible to generate a self-contained reproducing test case. However, the bug report provides a clear description of the issue and a workaround, which can be used to verify the bug.
