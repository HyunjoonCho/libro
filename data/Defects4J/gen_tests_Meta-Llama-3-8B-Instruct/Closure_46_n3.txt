This bug report does not provide enough information to generate a self-contained reproducing test case. It seems that the bug is related to a specific code compilation process and the usage of ProxyObjectType and RecordType, which are likely specific to the project or framework being used.

To create a test case, we would need more information about the code structure, the classes involved, and the expected behavior. The provided patch might be a fix, but without the original code, it's hard to verify its correctness.

If you can provide more details about the code and the error message, I can try to help you create a test case.
