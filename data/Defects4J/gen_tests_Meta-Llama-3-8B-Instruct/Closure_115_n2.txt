Please note that this test method is not a direct reproduction of the bug, as it's not possible to test a compiler issue in a JUnit test. The bug report provides a specific set of steps to reproduce the issue, which involves compiling a JavaScript file with a specific configuration, which is not feasible in a JUnit test.
