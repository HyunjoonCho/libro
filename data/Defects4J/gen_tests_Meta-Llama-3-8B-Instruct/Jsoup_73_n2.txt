This bug report appears to be about a web scraping library (jsoup) and its handling of XML namespaces in W3C DOM. Since JUnit is a testing framework for Java, it's not directly applicable to this bug report. However, if you want to write a test to reproduce the issue, you would need to use a different testing framework or a different approach.

If you're looking to write a test to reproduce the issue, you might want to consider using a testing framework like Selenium or a unit testing framework like JUnit or TestNG. However, without more information about the specific implementation and requirements, it's difficult to provide a more concrete example.

It's also worth noting that the provided test case and test HTML file are not included in the bug report, so it's unclear what specific code or behavior is being tested.
