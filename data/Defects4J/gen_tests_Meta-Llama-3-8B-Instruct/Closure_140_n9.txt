I'm happy to help! However, the provided bug report lacks information about the specific issue or failure behavior. It appears to be a brief note without any details about the problem or the expected outcome. Without more context, it's challenging to generate a JUnit test method that reproduces the failure behavior.

If you could provide more information about the issue, such as the expected input, output, and the observed behavior, I'd be happy to help you create a test method that reproduces the failure.
