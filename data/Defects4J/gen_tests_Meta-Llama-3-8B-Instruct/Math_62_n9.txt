public void testConvergenceChecker() {
    ConvergenceChecker checker = new DefaultConvergenceChecker();
    assertEquals(false, checker.converged(null, null));
}

This test method creates an instance of the DefaultConvergenceChecker and calls the converged method with null arguments, which should return false. The bug report states that the convergence checker must be used with specific optimization algorithms, but it does not specify how to use it correctly. This test method is intended to reproduce the issue where the convergence checker is not used correctly.
