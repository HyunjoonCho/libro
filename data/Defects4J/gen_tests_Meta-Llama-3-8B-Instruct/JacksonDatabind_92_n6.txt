Since this is not a specific bug report with a reproducing test case, but rather an announcement of a planned fix, I cannot generate a test case for this bug report. The bug report is actually announcing a planned fix for CVE 2017-15095, which involves blocking more JDK types from polymorphic deserialization in Jackson Databind.
