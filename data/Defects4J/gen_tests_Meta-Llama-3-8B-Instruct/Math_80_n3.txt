This test case is already written in Java and can be used as is. It tests the `EigenDecompositionImpl` class by creating an instance with two tridiagonal matrices and then verifying that the resulting eigenvalues and eigenvectors match the reference values. The test case uses the `assertEquals` method to check for equality between the computed and reference values, and the `dotProduct` and `add`/`subtract` methods of the `ArrayRealVector` class to verify that the eigenvectors are correct.
