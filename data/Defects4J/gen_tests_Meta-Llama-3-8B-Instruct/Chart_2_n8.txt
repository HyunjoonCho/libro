It seems like the bug report is about the `iterateRangeBounds` method in `DatasetUtilities` class. However, the bug report does not provide a clear and concise description of the issue. It seems like the issue is explained in a forum post, which is not provided.

To generate a test case, we would need more information about the expected behavior and the conditions under which the bug occurs. Without this information, it is difficult to write a test case that reproduces the issue.

If the bug report is updated with more details about the expected behavior and the conditions under which the bug occurs, we can try to generate a test case that reproduces the issue.
