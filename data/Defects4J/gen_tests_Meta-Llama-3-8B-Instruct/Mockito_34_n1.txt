This bug report is not about a coding issue, but rather about the structure of a jar file. Therefore, it cannot be reproduced with a JUnit test case. However, it could be considered as a documentation bug, as it is about the structure of the jar file and not about the functionality of the library.

If the issue is about the structure of the jar file, it would be better to report it as a documentation bug and ask the library maintainers to correct the issue.
