    // Test issue 9: There remains some duplicate code
    // Test issue 10: The ConvergenceChecker interface is very general
    // Test issue 11: It is not clear whether it is wise to aggregate the counter of gradient evaluations to the function evaluation counter
    // Test issue 12: In AbstractLeastSquaresOptimizer and LevenbergMarquardtOptimizer, occurrences of OptimizationException were replaced by the unchecked ConvergenceException
    // Test issue 13: MultiStartUnivariateRealOptimizer
    // Test issue 14: The Javadoc utility raises warnings
    // Test issue 15: Some previously existing classes and interfaces have become no more than a specialisation of new "generics" classes

Note that this is just an example and you may need to modify it to fit the specific requirements of your test case.
