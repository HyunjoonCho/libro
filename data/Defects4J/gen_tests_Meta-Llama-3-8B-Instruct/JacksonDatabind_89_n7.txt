This bug report does not provide a specific reproducing test case. It seems to be a report of a security vulnerability and a plan to fix it by blocking certain types from polymorphic deserialization in Jackson Databind. The report does not provide a specific example of how to reproduce the issue, so it is not possible to generate a test case from it.
