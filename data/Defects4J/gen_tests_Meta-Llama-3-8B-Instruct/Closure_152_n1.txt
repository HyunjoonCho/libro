public void testResolveTypesUnionType() {
    // Create a test file with a union type
    String testFile = "function foo(x) { return x; }";
    // Compile the test file with the Closure Compiler

Note that this is just a hypothetical test method and may not actually reproduce the exact issue described in the bug report. To create a more accurate test method, you would need to provide a minimal, reproducible example (MRE) of the issue, which includes a JavaScript file that demonstrates the problem.
