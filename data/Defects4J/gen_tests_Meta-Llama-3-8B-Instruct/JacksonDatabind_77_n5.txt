public void testDeserialize() {
    ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
    String json = "{\"@type\":\"com.example.MyClass\"}";
    Object o = mapper.readValue(json, Object.class);
    // assert o is an instance of MyClass
}

This test method is not meant to reproduce the specific vulnerability, but it demonstrates how Jackson deserialization can lead to a potential security issue when the type of the object being deserialized is not properly validated.
