This bug report is not providing enough information to generate a self-contained reproducing test case. The bug report only mentions that it's a security vulnerability in Jackson Deserializer and provides an email address, but does not provide any specific code or data to reproduce the issue.

To create a test case, we would need more information such as the specific version of Jackson being used, the type of data being deserialized, and the expected behavior. Without this information, it's not possible to create a test case that reproduces the issue.
