The provided information is not sufficient to generate a self-contained reproducing test case. The bug report does not include the actual code that demonstrates the issue, only a link to a GitHub issue and a comment. 

To generate a test case, you would need to know the specific code that is being tested and the expected output. However, based on the description, it seems that the issue is related to the creation of `JsonStreamContext` objects for writing and converting, and that the `writeContext` is created differently than expected.

Without the actual code, it's impossible to write a test case that reproduces the issue. If you can provide the code, I can help you write a test case.
