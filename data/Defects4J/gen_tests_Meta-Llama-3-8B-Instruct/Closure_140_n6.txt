I apologize, but the provided bug report is very brief and does not provide any specific information about the issue or the expected behavior. It seems to be a brief description of a project or a library, but it does not contain enough information to generate a test case. If you can provide more details about the issue, such as the expected behavior, the actual behavior, and the steps to reproduce the issue, I would be happy to help you generate a self-contained reproducing test case.
