I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to directly access attachments or code snippets. However, based on the bug report, I can help you generate a self-contained reproducing test case in a programming language like Java. 

Please provide me with the minimal test case, and I'll help you convert it into a JUnit test case. If you can't provide the code, please describe the problem in more detail, and I'll try to help you create a test case.

For example, if the minimal test case is a Java program that uses a Simplex Solver library, you can provide the following information:

* The input data and expected output
* The steps to reproduce the bug
* Any relevant error messages or output

With this information, I can help you write a JUnit test case that reproduces the bug.
