Note that this bug report does not provide enough information to create a test method that reproduces the failure behavior, as it does not specify what the failure behavior is or what the expected result is. The bug report only asks to "Investigate why" a certain pull request did not trigger a release, but does not provide any specific details about the behavior being tested.
