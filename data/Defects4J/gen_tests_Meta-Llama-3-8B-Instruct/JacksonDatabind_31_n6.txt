The provided information is not enough to generate a test case. The bug report lacks specific details about the expected and actual behavior, as well as the code snippet that reproduces the issue. To generate a self-contained reproducing test case, more information is needed, such as:

1. The specific code that creates the `JsonStreamContext` for both write and convert methods.
2. The expected and actual output or behavior.
3. The specific steps to reproduce the issue.

Without this information, it's not possible to create a test case that accurately reproduces the issue.
