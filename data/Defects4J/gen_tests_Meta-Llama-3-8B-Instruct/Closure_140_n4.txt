I apologize, but the provided bug report does not contain enough information to generate a self-contained reproducing test case. The report lacks specific details about the expected behavior, actual behavior, and the steps to reproduce the issue. It appears to be a simple statement with no context or code snippet.

To generate a test case, I would need more information such as:

* What is the expected behavior of the Google Common Loader Extern?
* What is the actual behavior that is not meeting the expected behavior?
* What are the steps to reproduce the issue?

Please provide more details, and I'll be happy to help you generate a test case.
