public void testOptimizerPackageIssues() {
    // Test the issues mentioned in the bug report
    // For example, test the convergence checker in BrentOptimizer
    BrentOptimizer optimizer = new BrentOptimizer();
    optimizer.setConvergenceChecker(new...); // Set the convergence checker
    // Test the optimization process
    optimizer.optimize(...); // Perform optimization
    // Check the results
    assertEquals(..., optimizer.getOptimum()); // Check the optimum value
}

Note that this is just an example, and the actual test method would depend on the specific issues being tested. Additionally, the bug report is quite extensive and may require multiple test methods to fully reproduce the issues mentioned.
