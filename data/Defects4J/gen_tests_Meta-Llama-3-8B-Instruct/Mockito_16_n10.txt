This bug report is not a typical bug report that describes a specific issue in the code, but rather an investigation into why a specific pull request did not trigger a release. Therefore, it's not possible to generate a self-contained reproducing test case from this bug report. 

However, if the goal is to reproduce the issue, it would likely involve reproducing the conditions that led to the pull request not being triggered. This could involve analyzing the pull request and the release process, and then creating a test case that demonstrates the issue. However, this would require more information about the specific circumstances surrounding the issue.
