This bug report seems to be related to a web development issue, specifically with the Closure Compiler and CSS properties in Internet Explorer. JUnit tests are typically used for testing Java code, not CSS or web development. Therefore, it's not possible to write a JUnit test that reproduces this failure behavior.

However, if you're looking to test the functionality of a specific JavaScript code that is affected by this bug, you could use a JavaScript testing framework like Jest or Mocha.
