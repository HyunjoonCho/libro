It seems like this bug report is missing the actual description of the failure behavior. It only provides a link to a GitHub issue. Without more information, it's difficult to generate a JUnit test method that reproduces the failure behavior. Can you please provide more details about the failure behavior or the expected behavior that was not triggered?
