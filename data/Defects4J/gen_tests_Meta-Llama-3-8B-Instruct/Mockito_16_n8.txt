Since the bug report does not provide a specific code snippet or scenario to reproduce the issue, we cannot generate a self-contained test case. The issue seems to be related to a pull request (125) in a Git repository (mockito/mockito) that did not trigger a release. This is more of a process-related issue rather than a code-related issue, and it would require more context and information to reproduce.

However, if you can provide more details or context about the issue, I can try to help you generate a test case.
