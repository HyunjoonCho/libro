This test case is already a self-contained reproducing test case for the bug report. It tests the `EigenDecompositionImpl` class by comparing its results with the reference values computed using the Fortran LAPACK library. The test case includes the input matrices, reference eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and the expected results.
