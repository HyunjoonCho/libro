This bug report seems to be related to a specific code base and a specific type system, and does not provide enough information to generate a self-contained reproducing test case. The bug report mentions a `ProxyObjectType`, `RecordType`, and `NamedType`, which are likely specific to the code base and type system in question.

Without more information, it is not possible to generate a test case that reproduces the issue. The bug report also mentions a patch being attached, which suggests that the issue may have been fixed, but the patch is not provided in the bug report.

If you can provide more information about the code base and type system, I may be able to help you generate a test case.
