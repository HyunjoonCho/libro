Since the bug report is about a pull request not triggering a release, it's not possible to write a JUnit test method that reproduces the failure behavior as it's not a unit testable issue. Unit tests are used to test individual units of code, such as methods or classes, and are not suitable for testing complex system behavior like release triggers.
