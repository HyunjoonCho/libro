This bug report does not contain a specific test case that can be reproduced. The bug report seems to be about a security vulnerability in the c3p0 library, and it does not provide a specific test case that can be used to reproduce the issue. The report only mentions that there are two more c3p0 classes that need to be blocked to exploit the default typing issue, but it does not provide any details about how to reproduce the issue or what the specific classes are.

Therefore, it is not possible to generate a self-contained reproducing test case from this bug report.
