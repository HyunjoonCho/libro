This bug report does not provide enough information to generate a self-contained reproducing test case. The report does not provide any code or specific instructions on how to reproduce the issue. The URLs provided are also not relevant to the test case generation.

However, if the issue is related to a web application, we can generate a test case that simulates the URLs provided. We would need more information about the application, such as the technology stack, framework, and specific functionality that is causing the error.

If the issue is related to a specific method or function in the application, we can generate a test case that calls that method or function with specific input parameters. Again, more information about the application and the method or function is required to generate a test case.

In general, a self-contained reproducing test case should include the following:

1. A clear description of the test case
2. The expected result
3. The input data or parameters
4. The steps to reproduce the issue

Without this information, it is not possible to generate a self-contained reproducing test case.
