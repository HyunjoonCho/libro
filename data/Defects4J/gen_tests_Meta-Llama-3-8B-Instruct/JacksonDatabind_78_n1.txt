public void testJacksonDeserializerVulnerability() {
    // Create a JSON object that can be deserialized to a specific type
    String json = "{\"key\":\"value\"}";

    // Deserialize the JSON object using Jackson
    Object deserializedObject = new ObjectMapper().readValue(json, Object.class);

    // Verify that the deserialization was successful
    assertNotNull(deserializedObject);
}

Please note that this is a very basic test and might not actually reproduce the vulnerability. To reproduce the vulnerability, you would need to create a more complex test case that demonstrates the specific type of object that can be exploited.
