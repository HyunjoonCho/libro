Since the bug report doesn't provide a specific description of the failure behavior, I'll assume that the fix proposal is for a test that reproduces the original bug. However, without the original bug description, it's difficult to create a test that accurately reproduces the failure. 

If you can provide the original bug description or more context, I can help you generate a test method that reproduces the failure behavior.
