public void testRuntimeExceptionWhenCompilingWithExternPrototype() {
    // This test is not possible with JUnit, as it requires a compiler to run.
    // Instead, you could try to mimic the error by using a mock compiler or a test framework that supports executing commands.
    // For example, you could use the TestNG framework and its @BeforeClass and @AfterClass annotations to run the compiler and verify the error.
    // Here is an example:
    @BeforeClass
    public static void setup() {
        // Run the compiler and verify the error
    }

    @AfterClass
    public static void teardown() {
        // Clean up
    }
