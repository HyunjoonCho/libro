This bug report does not provide enough information to generate a self-contained reproducing test case. The bug report is describing a regression issue in a specific project and requires multiple steps to reproduce, including cloning two repositories and modifying a configuration file. The problem is not isolated to a specific method or class, and the provided code snippets are not sufficient to reproduce the issue.

To generate a test case, you would need to have access to the specific code and configuration files involved in the issue, which is not provided in the bug report. Additionally, the bug report does not provide any specific details about the expected behavior or the failure that occurs, making it difficult to write a test case that reproduces the issue.

If you have more information or specific code snippets that can be used to reproduce the issue, I would be happy to help you generate a test case.
