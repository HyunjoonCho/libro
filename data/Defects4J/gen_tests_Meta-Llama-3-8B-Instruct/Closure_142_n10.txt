public void testInternetExplorerRuntimeError() {
    // Create a test environment that mimics the bug report
    // This could involve creating a test HTML file, launching Internet Explorer, and verifying the expected output
    // Since this is a runtime error, it's difficult to create a direct test case
    // You could try to reproduce the error by creating a test that creates an array of arrays, sets a threshold, and attempts to sort the array
    // However, this would require a lot of setup and may not be feasible
    // Instead, you could try to create a test that tests the specific behavior mentioned in the bug report (i.e. IE passing arrays by value when threshold is large)
    // This could involve creating a test that creates an array of arrays, sets the threshold to a large value, and attempts to sort the array
    // You could then verify that the array is being passed by value and not by reference
