This is a JavaScript test, not a Java test. The bug report is about a JavaScript compiler error, and it's not possible to reproduce it using a JUnit test. JUnit is a testing framework for Java, and it's not applicable to JavaScript code. To reproduce the issue, you would need to write a JavaScript test using a testing framework like Jest or Mocha, or simply run the code in a JavaScript environment and see if it produces the same error.
