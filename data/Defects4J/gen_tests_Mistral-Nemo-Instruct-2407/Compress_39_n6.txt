This test method creates a byte array filled with data to simulate a truncated zip file. It then wraps this byte array in a `ByteArrayInputStream` and attempts to read the zip file using a `ZipInputStream`. The expected behavior is for an `EOFException` to be thrown when trying to read the next entry in the zip file, as the end of the file has been reached. If this exception is not thrown, the test will fail.
