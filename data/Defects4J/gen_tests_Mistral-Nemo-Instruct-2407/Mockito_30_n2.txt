    // Test 1: DefaultMockingDetailsTest.should_get_extra_interfaces
    // This test fails due to an incorrect usage of withSettings().extraInterfaces()
    // Changing the line as suggested in the bug report should make it pass

    // Test 2: NoJUnitDependenciesTest.pure_mockito_should_not_depend_JUnit___ByteBuddy
    // This test originally fails due to a dependency on JUnit
    // Changing the line in ClassLoaders.java as suggested in the bug report should make it pass
    // However, this test still fails because it is checking for dependencies in the test folder, which should not be excluded

    // Test 3: ClassLoadersTest.excluding_class_loader_cannot_load_classes_when_no_correct_source_url_set
    // This test is currently succeeding, but it is unclear why it is not throwing an exception
    // Further investigation is needed to understand why this test is not failing
