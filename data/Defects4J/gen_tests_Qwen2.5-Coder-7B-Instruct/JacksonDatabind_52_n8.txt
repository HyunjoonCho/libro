Unfortunately, I'm unable to access external links directly. However, based on your description, you seem to be encountering an issue where an external property is not being properly deserialized during JSON parsing using Jackson Databind. 

To help you debug this issue, please provide the relevant parts of your code, particularly the classes involved and how they are annotated for deserialization. This would allow me to suggest a solution or write a test case that might reproduce the issue. If possible, sharing the actual code snippets would be very helpful.
