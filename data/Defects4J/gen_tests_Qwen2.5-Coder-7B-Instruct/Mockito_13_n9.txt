Unfortunately, there isn't enough information provided in the bug report to generate a specific JUnit test method that reproduces the failure behavior. The description mentions a fix proposal for issue #114, but it doesn't provide details about the problem being fixed or how to reproduce it. Without additional context or steps to reproduce the issue, it's not possible to write a meaningful test case.
