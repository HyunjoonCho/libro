Unfortunately, there isn't enough information provided to write a JUnit test that reproduces the issue. We would need access to the HTML page mentioned in the bug report and potentially the actual unit test that is failing. Without this information, it's impossible to accurately reproduce the issue and create a relevant JUnit test.
