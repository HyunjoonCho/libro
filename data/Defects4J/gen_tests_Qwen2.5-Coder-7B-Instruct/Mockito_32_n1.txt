public void testMockPackagePrivateClass() {
    // This will throw an exception because Mockito cannot mock the package-private class
    MyClass myObject = Mockito.mock(MyClass.class);
}

In the above test case, `MyClass` is a package-private class. When we try to mock it using Mockito, it will throw an exception indicating that it is not possible to mock the class. This demonstrates the limitation of Mockito in handling package-private classes.
