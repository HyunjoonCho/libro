Unfortunately, without access to the specific codebase or the ability to reproduce the issue, it's difficult to generate a JUnit test method that reproduces the failure behavior. However, you could try creating a test case that generates a page with a large number of nested elements and measures the performance of Jsoup's parsing process. If the parsing time grows quadratically with the number of nested elements, then you may have reproduced the issue. You could then use this test case to verify any potential fixes or workarounds.
