  // This test is intended to illustrate the issue described in the bug report,
  // where only assignments to "this" issue a "dangerous use of the global this object"
  // warning, while reads do not.
  
  // Since the actual compiler and its behavior cannot be tested programmatically,
  // this test serves more as a placeholder to document the known issue.
  
  // The goal is to ensure that the test framework itself is set up correctly
  // and that future changes to the compiler do not inadvertently resolve this issue.
  
  // If the compiler is fixed, running this test should still produce a warning
  // for the writeMethodWithoutAnnotation case, indicating that the issue is resolved.
