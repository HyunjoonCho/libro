class MyClass {
    private final MyDependency myDependency;

    public MyClass(MyDependency myDependency) {
        this.myDependency = myDependency;
    }
}

// In your test class
MyDependency mockDependency = mock(MyDependency.class);
MyClass myClass = new MyClass(mockDependency);

2. Use setter injection: Similar to constructor injection, you can use setter methods to inject dependencies. This allows you to change the dependency at runtime, making it easier to write tests.

Example:
class MyClass {
    private MyDependency myDependency;

    public void setMyDependency(MyDependency myDependency) {
        this.myDependency = myDependency;
    }
}

// In your test class
MyDependency mockDependency = mock(MyDependency.class);
MyClass myClass = new
