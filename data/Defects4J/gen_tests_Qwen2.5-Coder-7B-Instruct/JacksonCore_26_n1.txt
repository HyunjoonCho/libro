The provided unit test already demonstrates the issue described in the bug report. It creates a non-blocking JSON parser, feeds it with an input array at an offset, and checks that the reported locations are incorrect. If the parser were correctly handling the offset, the reported locations would match the expected values. Since they do not, the test confirms the presence of the bug. No further changes are needed to reproduce the issue.
