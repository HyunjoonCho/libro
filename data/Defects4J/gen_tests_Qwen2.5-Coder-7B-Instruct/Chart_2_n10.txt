Unfortunately, there is no direct way to generate a self-contained reproducing test case without knowing the details of the issue. The link provided in the description is a forum post which contains the detailed explanation and steps to reproduce the issue.

However, based on the information provided in the title and description, it seems like the `iterateRangeBounds()` methods in the `DatasetUtilities` class may be incorrectly handling some edge cases. 

A possible test case could involve creating a dataset with specific range bounds and calling the `iterateRangeBounds()` method to verify that the returned bounds are correct. If the method is indeed buggy, the test case would fail, indicating that the issue needs to be fixed.
