public class YourClassTest {

    private YourClass yourClass;

    @Before
    public void setUp() {
        Dependency dependency = new Dependency();
        yourClass = new YourClass(dependency);
    }

    @Test
    public void testSomething() {
        // Arrange
        // Act
        // Assert
    }
}

In the above example, `YourClass` would look like this:

public class YourClass {
    
    private final Dependency dependency;

    public YourClass(Dependency dependency) {
        this.dependency = dependency;
    }
    
    // Class methods...
}

By using constructor injection, you avoid the need for Mockito to modify final fields and also make your class easier to understand and maintain.
