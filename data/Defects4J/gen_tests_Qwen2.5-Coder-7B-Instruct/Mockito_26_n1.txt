MyClass myObject = new MyClass();
myObject.setFinalField(mock(FinalFieldType.class));

Alternatively, you can use PowerMockito, which extends Mockito and provides additional features such as mocking final classes, methods, and fields. However, keep in mind that PowerMockito has its own set of trade-offs and may not be suitable for all projects.

To request the return of the `@InjectMocks` feature for final fields, you can submit an issue on the Mockito GitHub repository with your reasoning and use case.
