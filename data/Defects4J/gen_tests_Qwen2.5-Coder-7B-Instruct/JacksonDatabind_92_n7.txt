The description provided does not contain enough information to generate a JUnit test method that reproduces a failure. It appears to be describing a security feature or enhancement related to Jackson Databind's handling of polymorphic deserialization. Without details about the specific issue or expected behavior, it's not possible to write a test case that would fail under normal circumstances. If you can provide more context or specify the exact problem you're trying to reproduce, I'd be happy to help create a suitable test method.
