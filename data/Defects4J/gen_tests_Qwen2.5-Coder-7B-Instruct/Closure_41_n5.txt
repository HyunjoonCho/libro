    // This test is expected to fail in ADVANCED mode due to the incorrect implementation of overridden methods with different signatures.
    // The compiler should issue a warning for both Bar.prototype.add and Bar.prototype.sub.
    // However, in ADVANCED mode, it only issues a warning for Bar.prototype.add.
    // This test serves as a reminder to address the issue and ensure consistent warnings across all overridden methods.
