Unfortunately, there isn't enough information provided in the bug report to generate a specific JUnit test method that reproduces the failure behavior. Could you please provide more details about the issue, such as the expected and actual results, the input data, and the relevant code snippets? With this additional information, I would be happy to help you generate a test method that reproduces the failure.
