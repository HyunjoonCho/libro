public void testMockPackagePrivateClassThrowsException() {

In this test, we attempt to mock `SomePackagePrivateClass`, which is a package-private class. We expect an `IllegalArgumentException` to be thrown because Mockito cannot mock package-private classes. If the exception is thrown, we then verify that the message contains the expected text. If the exception is not thrown, we call `fail()` to indicate that the test has failed.
