Unfortunately, there is no provided link to the forum post mentioned in the bug report. However, based on the title, it appears that there may be issues with the `iterateRangeBounds()` methods in the `DatasetUtilities` class. To create a self-contained reproducing test case, you would need to provide more details about the specific issue(s) being experienced, including example inputs and expected outputs. Once you have provided more information, I would be happy to help generate a test case that reproduces the problem.
