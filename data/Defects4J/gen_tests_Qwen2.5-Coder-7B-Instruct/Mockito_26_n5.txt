private final YourClass yourField;

// Constructor or other initialization code

public void setYourField(YourClass yourField) {
    this.yourField = yourField;
}

Then, in your test class, use MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(this) and then call the setter method manually:

@Before
public void setUp() {
    MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(this);
    yourService.setYourField(mock(YourClass.class));
}

Remember to replace "YourClass" and "yourField" with the actual type and name of your field respectively. 

This approach avoids cluttering your classes with unnecessary constructor parameters or accessor methods for testing purposes.
