public void testStackOverflowError() {
    // This test is designed to reproduce a StackOverflowError by triggering the problematic code
    // in version 1.11.1 of the library. Since the error occurs at runtime and depends on external factors,
    // such as network conditions and server responses, a direct unit test is challenging.
    
    // To simulate the issue, you would typically need to:
    // 1. Set up a mock environment that mimics the production setup (e.g., using a proxy or stubbing out dependencies).
    // 2. Trigger the code path that leads to the StackOverflowError.
    // 3. Assert that the error is thrown.
    
    // However, without access to the internal implementation details and knowing exactly how the error occurs,
    // it's difficult to provide a precise test case. Instead, you might want to focus on integration tests or system tests
    // that verify the application behaves correctly under various conditions.
    
    // For example, you could write a test that attempts to load data from the URLs provided in the description
    // and asserts that the application doesn't crash or produce unexpected results.
    
    // Here's a hypothetical example of what such a test might look
