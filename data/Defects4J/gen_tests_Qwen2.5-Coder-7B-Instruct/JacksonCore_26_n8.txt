The provided unit test already reproduces the failure behavior as described in the bug report. It checks that the reported locations are affected by the input array offset. If the bug were fixed, the assertions would pass with expected values. Since the bug report indicates that the reported locations are 2 bytes off, the assertions would fail unless the bug is resolved.
